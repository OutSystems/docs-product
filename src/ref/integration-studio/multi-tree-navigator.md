# Multi-tree Navigator

The **Multi-tree Navigator** is the area of your [workspace](<workspace.md>) where you can see the elements and resources associated with your extension. The Multi-tree navigator has two tabs: Extension and Resources.

Extension tab
:   Tree with the [actions](<../../integration-with-systems/integration-studio/managing-extensions/action-define.md>), [entities](<../../integration-with-systems/integration-studio/managing-extensions/entity-define.md>), and [structures](<../../integration-with-systems/integration-studio/managing-extensions/structure-define.md>) defined in the current extension, organized in separate folders. With a right-click on these folders, you have the options of creating and deleting an element.

Resources tab
:   Tree with the resources associated with the current extension. For more information, see [Resources](<resources-tree.md>) tree.
