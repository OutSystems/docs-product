# Floating Content

<div class="info" markdown="1">

Applies to Mobile Apps and Reactive Web Apps only

</div>

You can use the Floating Content UI Pattern to display content on top of other screen elements, such as a map with navigation instructions.

**How to use the Floating Content UI Pattern**

1. In Service Studio, in the Toolbox, search for `Floating Content`.

    The Floating Content widget is displayed.

    ![Screenshot of the Floating Content widget in the Service Studio toolbox](images/floatingcontent-2-ss.png "Floating Content Widget in Service Studio")

    If the UI widget doesn't display, it's because the dependency isn't added. This happens because the Remove unused references setting is enabled. To make the widget available in your app:

    1. In the Toolbox, click **Search in other modules**.

    1. In **Search in other Modules**, remove any spaces between words in your search text.
    
    1. Select the widget you want to add from the **OutSystemsUI** module, and click **Add Dependency**. 
    
    1. In the Toolbox, search for the widget again.

1. From the Toolbox, drag the Floating Content widget into the Main Content area of your application's screen.

    In this example, the Main Content area of already contains an image of a map. 

    ![Screenshot illustrating how to drag the Floating Content widget into the Main Content area of an application screen](images/floatingcontent-3-ss.png "Dragging Floating Content Widget to Main Content Area")

    By default, the Floating Content widget contains a Content placeholder.

1. Add the relevant content to the placeholder.

    In this example, we add a Search widget.

1. Select the Floating Content widget, and on the **Properties** tab, set the mandatory **Position** property. This defines where the widget is displayed. You can customize the Section's look and feel by setting any of the (optional) properties.

After following these steps and publishing the module, you can test the pattern in your app.
