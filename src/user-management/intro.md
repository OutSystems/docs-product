# User management

## User providers
The **Users** module serves as the default user provider that enables single sign-on for end-users. It is possible to create and use other modules as user providers. In doing so, all modules using that user provider will share a source of user records and active sessions.

A user provider has a default tenant, which hosts the users that are created and managed by it. However, new tenants can be created to build multi-tenant applications. To learn more about multi-tenancy, refer to [How to build a multi-tenant application](https://success.outsystems.com/documentation/how_to_guides/development/how_to_build_a_multi_tenant_application/).
