# Invalid Page Name

Service Studio shows **Invalid Page Name Error**:

* Page Name in [screen name] screen contains invalid characters. Please use only digits, letters, or any of these special characters: `-`, `~`, `/`.

Some characters in the URLs have special uses and you can't use those characters in the **Page Name** property. To fix the error, remove all characters different from letters, digits, dash (`-`), tilde (`~`), or forward slash (`/`).
