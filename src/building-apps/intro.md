# Building apps

You develop apps in Service Studio, the main IDE in OutSystems. A new app usually contains one module with a user interface, and you can use that module to start building your app.

If you're just starting with OutSystems, here are some useful resources:

* Create your first app by following instructions from the tutorial [Create Your First Reactive Web App](../getting-started/create-reactive-web.md).
* If you prefer an interactive guide, start Service Studio, and from the **Help** menu select **Build an App in 5 min tutorial**.
* For an in-depth free video course, check out [Becoming a Reactive Web Developer](https://www.outsystems.com/learn/paths/18/becoming-a-reactive-web-developer/).

For developers already familiar with OutSystems, explore the sections in this chapter for more information.
