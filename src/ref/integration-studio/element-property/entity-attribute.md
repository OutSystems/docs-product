# Entity Attribute Properties

The next table presents the properties of the [entity attribute](<../../../integration-with-systems/integration-studio/managing-extensions/entity-attribute.md>) element.  
  
|Property|Description|Optionality|Default value|Obs.|
|--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |
|Name|Name of the attribute.|Mandatory|`Attribute `|You should change the name of the attribute to a suitable value.<br/>See [rules for naming elements](<../element-naming.md>).|
|Original Name|Name of the column in the source database. Can contain any kind of characters supported by the DBMS.|Optional||Automatically filled when introspecting a database.<br/>If this property is empty, the "Name" property value will be used.<br/>![Warning icon indicating potential runtime errors when changing the 'Original Name' property in an imported entity attribute](images/warning.gif "Warning Icon") If you change this property value in an imported entity attribute, you might have runtime errors.|
|Original Type|Type of the attribute in the source database. Can be any value supported by the database.|Optional||Automatically filled when introspecting a database.|
|Mandatory|Indicates whether the attribute is mandatory or optional.|Mandatory|`Mandatory`|To define an attribute as optional, simply un-check this property.|
|Auto Generated|Indicates whether the attribute value is generated by the database. The platform sets the generated value in this attribute after the record has been inserted in the database.|Optional|||
|Data Type|Indicates the type of the attribute. Only basic data types such as `Text` or `Integer` are available.|Mandatory||The possible values are presented in a drop-down list. For more information, see available data types.<br/>Since OutSystems has its own data types, you should check how Database data types are translated into OutSystems' data types. Check the mapping for Oracle or SQL Server.<br/>If you override an attribute data type (which value was initially defined when importing an entity from a database) by manually selecting a different value, this override value will be kept when you refresh the entity.|
|Default value|Default value that is used if no value for this attribute is provided in the module that is using this action.|Optional|||
|Length|Size of the attribute.|Optional||This property is only available for `Text` and `Decimal` types. In the `Decimal` type, this property corresponds to the number of digits, including the decimal part. If the values for these data types are not specified, default values are used.<br/>The rest of the data types have a fixed length.|
|Decimals|Number of decimal places.|Optional||This property is only available when the data type is `Decimal` and corresponds to the number of digits of the decimal part.|
|Ignore|Indicates if the attribute should be ignored in runtime. Attributes set as ignored will not be present in the entity when you use it in your applications and will not be considered during verification and compilation phases.|Mandatory|`False` <br/>(see "Obs.")|When a table has a column with a type that cannot be used by OutSystems (ex: `Geometry`), the entity attribute is automatically set as ignored (Ignore = `True`) after importing the table.|
|Description|Description of the parameter.|Optional||By default the description is empty, but you should provide a small description of the semantic of this parameter. The maximum allowed size for descriptions is 255 characters.|
