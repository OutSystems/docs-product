# Entity Attributes

Once your entity is [created](<entity-define.md>), you can add, change, or delete its parameters in the [Attributes Editor](../../../ref/integration-studio/editor/attributes.md).

You have to create the attributes according to the definition of the database table that you want to access in your application.
