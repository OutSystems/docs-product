# Enable TLS communication in RabbitMQ

To enable TLS you must manually configure the port used by the TLS listener as well as its certificate and corresponding key.

**Note:** To generate certificates and keys, follow the recommendations provided in the [TLS Support](https://www.rabbitmq.com/ssl.html) page of the official RabbitMQ documentation.

To enable TLS communication do the following:

1. Open the `%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\RabbitMQ\advanced.config` configuration file.  
_Note:_ If they do not exist, create the `RabbitMQ` folder and the `advanced.config` file.
 
1. Add the following lines:

        [
        {rabbit, [
            {tcp_listeners, []},
            {ssl_listeners, [5671]},
            {ssl_options, [{certfile,"C:\\path\\to\\server\\cert.pem"},
                            {keyfile,"C:\\path\\to\\server\\key.pem"}]}
        ]}
        ].

This configuration does the following: 

1. Disables all non-TLS listeners (`tcp_listeners`)

    Note: You must also ensure that the `RABBITMQ_NODE_PORT` environment variable is **not set** for this configuration to be effective.

2. Creates an TLS listener on port 5671 (`ssl_listeners`)

3. Configures the certificate and its key to be used by the TLS listener (`ssl_options`)

To apply these settings do the following:

1. In the Configuration Tool, open the Cache tab.

1. Set the Port parameter to the same port as in the configuration file (in the example above, the Port value would be `5671`).

1. Click "Create/Upgrade Service".

Alternatively, check [Install and configure RabbitMQ using the command-line](<installation.md>) for more information on how to apply the settings using the command-line.

## Configuring the certificate canonical name

If the canonical name used in the certificate does not match the host name of the machine running the RabbitMQ service, you must manually configure a parameter in the `server.hsconf` file.

Do the following:

1. Open the `server.hsconf` file and check if there's a section named `CacheInvalidationConfiguration` in the file.  
    If the section **does not** exist, you can add it automatically by doing the following:
    
    1. Open Configuration Tool.
    1. Open the Cache tab and fill in the configuration values for the RabbitMQ service.
    1. Close the Configuration Tool and, in the "Configuration changed" dialog box, confirm that you wish to save your changes by clicking "Yes".
    
    The `CacheInvalidationConfiguration` section should now exist in `server.hsconf`.

1. In `server.hsconf`, set the value of the `TlsServerCanonicalName` parameter in the `CacheInvalidationConfiguration` section to the certificate canonical name.

1. Open Configuration Tool and click "Apply and Exit" to apply the new setting.
