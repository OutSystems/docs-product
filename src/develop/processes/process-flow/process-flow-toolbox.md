# Process Flow Toolbox

When defining the process flow of your processes, Service Studio provides the following Tools:

| Tool      | Description    |
|:----------|:---------------|
| Start | Starts the process flow. Only one Start element is allowed in a process flow. |
| Conditional Start | Starts an alternative flow in the process flow. How to use a [Conditional Start](https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/11/Reference/OutSystems_Language/Processes/Process_Tools/Conditional_Start). |
| Human Activity | Activity to be executed by a human being. How to use a [Human Activity](https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/11/Reference/OutSystems_Language/Processes/Process_Tools/Human_Activity). |
| Send Email | Sends an Email to one or more recipients. How to use a [Send Email](https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/11/Reference/OutSystems_Language/Processes/Process_Tools/Send_Email). | 
| Automatic Activity | Executes an action flow to do some work without the need of human intervention. How to use an [Automatic Activity](https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/11/Reference/OutSystems_Language/Processes/Process_Tools/Automatic_Activity?_gl=1*1x6joj8*_ga*ODg5MTQxMzYxLjE2NTUyMTg3ODE.*_ga_ZD4DTMHWR2*MTY2MjM2NzgwOS4xNTYuMS4xNjYyMzY4MDg5LjUuMC4w). |
| Execute Process | Executes another process as an activity of the current process. How to use an [Execute Process](https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/11/Reference/OutSystems_Language/Processes/Process_Tools/Execute_Process). |
| Wait | Puts the process flow execution on hold until a specific event occurs. How to use a [Wait](https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/11/Reference/OutSystems_Language/Processes/Process_Tools/Wait). |
| Decision | Branches the process flow path into multiple paths but only one is followed. How to use a [Decision](https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/11/Reference/OutSystems_Language/Processes/Process_Tools/Decision). |
| End | Ends the process flow. For a matter of organization, you can have more than one End element in the same process flow. How to use an [End](https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/11/Reference/OutSystems_Language/Processes/Process_Tools/Process_End). |
| Comment | Allows you to add comments to your process flow. |

Each process activity created in your process flow using a process tool has a life cycle.
