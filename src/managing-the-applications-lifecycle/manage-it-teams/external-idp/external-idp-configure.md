# Configuring IT Users Authentication with External IdP via OpenId Connect

Before using the **IT Users Authentication with External IdP (OIDC)** feature in the OutSystems platform, you must configure the external IdP. The IdP must comply with the [OIDC Protocol](https://openid.net/connect/) and support the [Discovery](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html#IssuerDiscovery) feature that defines how clients dynamically discover information about OpenID providers.

See the following articles for configuration instructions:

* [Configuring Microsoft Azure AD authentication](external-idp-azure.md)

* [Configuring Okta authentication](external-idp-okta.md)

* [Configuring LifeTime authentication](external-idp-lifetime.md)
