When [the App Feedback is enabled](<user-feedback-enable.md>) for a Web application, a glowing circle is displayed on the application screens (close to the bottom-right corner).

The steps to send feedback are the following:

1. Click on the glowing circle to open the feedback pop-up window.
1. On the feedback window, type the feedback text. 
1. If the feedback is about a specific area or element on the screen, click on that area or element. It may help developers in better understanding the problem.
1. Press SEND to submit the feedback.
