# Center Content

You can use the Center Content UI Pattern to vertically align content to the center of its container.

**How to use the Center Content UI Pattern**

1. In Service Studio, in the Toolbox, search for `Center Content`.

    The Center Content widget is displayed.

    ![](<images/centercontent-2-ss.png>)

    If the UI widget doesn't display, it's because the dependency isn't added. For example, if you are using a ready-made app, it deletes unused widgets from the module. To make the widget available in your app:

    1. In the Toolbox, click **Search in other modules**.

    1. In **Search in other Modules**, remove any spaces between words in your search text.
    
    1. Select the widget you want to add from the **OutSystemsUI** module, and click **Add Dependency**. 
    
    1. In the Toolbox, search for the widget again.

1. From the Toolbox, drag the Center Content widget into the Main Content area of your application's screen.

    ![](<images/centercontent-3-ss.png>)

    By default, the Center Content widget contains Top, Center, and Bottom placeholders.

1. Add the relevant content to each of the placeholders. In this example we add some images and text.

    ![](<images/centercontent-4-ss.png>)

After following these steps and publishing the module, you can test the pattern in your app.
