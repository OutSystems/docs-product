You can also use the [chatbot configuration wizard](configuration-wizard.md) to set up this part of chatbot.

2. Click **Create a knowledge base** in the top menu.

3. You can skip **STEP 1: Create a QnA service in Microsoft Azure** if you already have a QnA service in Azure. If you don't have a QnA service in Azure check [Create QnA Maker for instructions](guide-azure-services.md#create-qna-service). 
    
    <div class="info" markdown="1">

    The availability of the settings in Azure depends on your Azure account permissions. You may have to ask your administrators to create resources if your account doesn't have permissions to create them.

    </div>

4. In **STEP 2: Connect your QnA service to your KB** click **Refresh** and select the values for each of the settings. If you have an existing QnA service these options should be already set for you. 
5. In **STEP 3: Name your KB** enter the knowledge base name in the field.
6. In **STEP 4: Populate your KB** use the following options:

    * **File name**. Click **Add file** and select the XLSX file with your [sample questions and answers](#sample-questions-and-answers).
    * **Chit-chat**. The chit-chat knowledge base contains light social conversation. Select a knowledge base that's appropriate for your brand voice. Skip this option if you want to add the chit-chat later.

7. In **STEP 5: Create your KB** click **Create your KB**. After a few moments, your knowledge base opens.

## Test your knowledge base { #test-kb }

Follow these steps to test your knowledge base.

1. Go to the [QnA Maker portal](https://www.qnamaker.ai/) and sign in.
2. Click **My knowledge bases** in the top menu and then select your knowledge base.
3. The knowledge base editor opens. Click **TEST** to open a chat interface and start entering some questions.

If you're not happy with how your knowledge base performs, you can edit it. Click **EDIT** to add, edit or remove the question-answer pairs. Make sure you click **Save and train** after you edit your knowledge base.  

## Publish your knowledge base and create a chatbot service { #publish-kb }

Once you're satisfied with how the knowledge base performs, publish it to make it available for the chatbot. The publishing is the step that pushes the knowledge base to production.
