# Cross-region disaster recovery

<div class="info" markdown="1">

OutSystems cross-region disaster recovery (XRDR) requires the subscription of an add-on. Please contact your OutSystems account team for more information.

OutSystems cross-region disaster recovery (XRDR) is a strategy that allows you to recover your OutSystems Cloud platform from the complete loss of an Amazon Web Services (AWS) or OutSystems Cloud region. The strategy involves backing up your data, apps, and cloud infrastructure across different geographic regions. With cross-region disaster recovery, you get business continuity and data protection against the most impactful natural or man-made disasters.

## Key concepts of cross-region disaster recovery

The following are some of the key concepts of cross-region disaster recovery:

* **Failover and failback**

    * Failover: The operations switch from the primary site to the secondary site during a disaster.

    * Failback: The process of returning operations to the primary site once it's restored.

* **Cross-region data backup**

    * Regular data backups between different cloud regions to enable the full recovery of an OutSystems Cloud platform based on these backups.

* **Recovery point objective (RPO)**

    * Defines the point in time to which data must be recovered after a disruption. For example, if an organization has an RPO of 4 hours, it means that the organization can tolerate losing up to 4 hours worth of data but no more.

* **Recovery time objective (RTO)**

    * Refers to the maximum acceptable amount of time that a system, app, or process can be down after a failure or disruption. For example, if an organization has an RTO of 2 hours, it means that the system or process must be up and running within 2 hours of an outage. 

    The following diagram illustrates the recovery point objective before the disaster and the recovery time objective after the disaster.

## Benefits of cross-region disaster recovery

The following are some of the benefits of cross-region disaster recovery:

* **Enhanced resilience and business continuity**

    * You can recover your business-critical apps even when faced with the most impactful and disruptive events, which may affect a region within a 100-kilometer radius.

* **Improved data protection**

    * With cross-region data recovery, you can best protect your data by storing it encrypted in different locations.

* **Compliance**

    * For many industries (for example, healthcare and government), a business continuity disaster recovery plan that is compliant with disasters that may affect a region within a 100-kilometer radius is mandatory. OutSystems XRDR allows you to choose the recovery region from any of the available OutSystems Cloud regions. 

    * Data sovereignty: With OutSystems XRDR, you can choose the recovery region from any of the available OutSystems Cloud regions.

## How cross-regional disaster recovery works

1. Primary region: This is the main operational site where applications are running and data is stored. It is fully functional and serves end-users.

2. Disaster recovery region: A recovery site is located in a different geographic region. When the primary site is healthy, this site only contains regular data backups, stored and updated with a frequency dependent on the contracted RPO.

3. Cross-region backup: Data from the primary site is copied to the recovery site, using backups, on a fixed schedule of no more than 24 hours, depending on the contracted RPO.
