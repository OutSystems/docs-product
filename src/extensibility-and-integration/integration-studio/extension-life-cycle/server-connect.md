# Connect to a Server

You must connect to a server when you want to execute the following operations: [1-Click Publish](<extension-1-cp.md>), [Download an Extension](<../managing-extensions/extension-download.md>) and, [Import Entities from a Database](<../managing-extensions/entity-import-from-database.md>).

## Connecting to a Server

You can explicitly connect to a server or let Integration Studio prompt you to connect whenever you must be connected but are not; for example, if you are publishing the extension. In both situations the [Select server window](<../../../ref/integration-studio/menu/file/server-select-window.md>) is displayed.

In the **File** menu or in the toolbar, click ![](images/connect-server.gif) **Select server...** and specify the parameters presented below.

## Connection Information

Once you are connected to a server, Integration Studio presents you information about the connection:

Title bar
:   Contains the name of the Platform Server you are connected to; for example `MyExtension@HubServer`.

Status bar
:   Contains the name of the Platform Server you are connected to and the username of the user that established the connection.
