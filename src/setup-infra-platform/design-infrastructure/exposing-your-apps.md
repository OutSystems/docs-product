# Exposing your applications

<div class="info" markdown="1">

**Important:** The information in this guide applies only to OutSystems Platform on-premises or private cloud deployments.

An important part of designing your OutSystems Platform infrastructure is protecting your applications from external threats.

Two of the strategies you can implement are the use of **Load Balancers** and **Reverse Proxies**. Both provide high availability, SSL offloading and prevent direct contact with the Internet.

To learn about these topics in more detail, check the following guides:
