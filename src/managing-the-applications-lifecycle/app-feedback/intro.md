# Gather user feedback

A group of users can share feedback about an app directly from the app. The feedback is immediately available to the development team for review through the **App Feedback** app. Check out how to [activate the feedback feature in an environment](user-feedback-enable.md),

The feedback users send consists of:

* Date and time
* User name
* Status
* Screenshot
* Feedback text or a voice message
* Screen resolution
* Operating system
