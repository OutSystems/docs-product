# Stream logs to New Relic

This article explains how you can set up log streaming from OutSystems applications to the New Relic APM tool.

## Prerequisites

* Enabled [Log separation](../../setup-infra-platform/setup/logging-db/logs-separation-cloud/intro.md).

* Installed Platform Server version 11.23.1 or higher.

* Installed LifeTime version 11.19.0 or higher.

## Set up log streaming

To set up the OutSystems log streaming service, using **New Relic** as the destination tool, get the New Relic API key and the location for New relic account (U.S. or EU).

Once you have these values, go to LifeTime and [configure the log streaming service](lifetime-streaming.md).
