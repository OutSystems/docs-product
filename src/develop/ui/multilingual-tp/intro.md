# Technical Preview - Multilingual Reactive Web and Mobile Apps

<div class="info" markdown="1">

## Prerequisites { #prerequisites }

To translate **Reactive Web** and **Mobile Apps** in Service Studio, as part of a technical preview, you need to meet the following requirements:

* Platform Server 11.10.0 or later
* LifeTime 11.6.0 or later
* Up to date Service Studio
* You activated the [technical preview](https://success.outsystems.com/Support/Enterprise_Customers/Upgrading/Technical_Preview_features) **Multilingual for Mobile and Reactive** in LifeTime

</div>

You design the UI in the default language, and the app shows in that language by default. You can translate the app to other languages, and then let users switch between the UI languages.

The default language is **en-US**. All language codes are in the [RFC 1766](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1766) standard format, and they're **case sensitive**. The platform detects right-to-left locales automatically and adjusts the styles.

Here's how to get started:

* For instructions on how to translate your app directly in Service Studio, see [Translate your app](translate-your-app.md).
* If you want to extract text for sending it to a translation service, see [Translation management](translation-management.md).
* For instructions on how to translate older, Traditional Web Apps, see [this section](../multilingual/intro.md).

You can translate the following elements of your app:

* Text in Buttons, Links, Screens
* Screen titles
* Instructions in Human Activities
* Validation messages, widget confirmation messages, and empty state messages
* Text literals in expressions
