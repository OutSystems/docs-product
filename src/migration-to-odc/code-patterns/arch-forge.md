# Asset consuming a Forge component

[Forge](https://www.outsystems.com/forge/) components are reusable software assets that help overcome technical challenges and solve business use cases. Forge is available in ODC via the ODC Portal. However, not all O11 Forge components are yet available in the ODC version. 

## How to solve

This pattern can be solved in O11 or in ODC. Start by checking if the Forge component is already [available in ODC](https://www.outsystems.com/forge/list?q=&t=&o=latest-submitted&tr=False&oss=False&c=%20&a=&v=odc&hd=False&tn=&scat=forge).

If the Forge component that your asset consumes is **already available in ODC**, you can choose to [solve this pattern in ODC](#solve-in-odc). 

If the Forge component that your asset consumes **isn’t yet available in ODC**, you should [solve this pattern in O11](#solve-in-o11).

### Solve in ODC

To solve this pattern in ODC:

1. Remove the reference to the O11 Forge component from any ODC asset.

1. Proceed with the migration. 

1. Once the consumer asset is migrated to ODC, add the reference to the ODC Forge asset that offers the same functionality as the O11 Forge component your asset was consuming.

1. After adding the reference, fix any outstanding issues.

### Solve in O11

To solve this pattern in O11:

1. Clone the Forge component.

1. In the consumer modules, replace the O11 Forge component usage with your clone.

1. Map the clone into an ODC asset, so it is included in your O11 to ODC architecture mapping.

1. Proceed with the migration.

By doing the above, your asset is no longer consuming an O11 Forge component. Instead, it is consuming the clone, which is also mapped to an ODC asset.

After migrating the component, consider [submitting the asset to ODC Forge](https://success.outsystems.com/documentation/outsystems_developer_cloud/building_apps/forge/submit_assets_to_forge/).

Note that, by cloning and migrating the Forge component yourself, you’ll own it after the migration. This means you'll have to consider any further improvements or bug fixing.
