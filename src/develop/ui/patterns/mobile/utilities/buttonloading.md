# Button Loading

You can use the Button Loading UI Pattern to call actions that don't run immediately, provide a visual hint, and disable the button from being clicked until it becomes available again.


**How to use the Button Loading UI Pattern**

1. In Service Studio, in the Toolbox, search for `Button Loading`.

    The Button Loading widget is displayed.

    ![](<images/buttonloading-1-ss.png>)

1. From the Toolbox, drag the Button Loading widget into the Main Content area of your application's screen.

    In this example, we drag the widget onto a form that is already in the Main Content area.

    By default the **Button Loading** widget contains a **Button** widget. We change the text of the button to **Create New User**.

    ![](<images/buttonloading-2-ss.png>)

3. Create a new local variable (of Boolean type) to control the state of the **Button Loading** widget. In this example, we call it **CreatingNewUser** and set the default value to **False**.

1. In this example, we also set the **ShowLoadingAndLabel** property to **False** so that the spinner doesn't show while the button logic is being executed.

    ![](<images/buttonloading-4-ss.png>)

5. Double-click the **Button** widget and add the necessary logic. In this example, the **ButtonOnClick** action creates a new user. We also add **Assign** logic for the **Button Loading** widget. The first Assign has the **CreatingNewUser** set to **False**. This is so the spinner doesn't display. The second Assign has the **CreatingNewUser** set to **True**. (The logic is added between the two Assigns.)

After following these steps and publishing the module, you can test the pattern in your app.
