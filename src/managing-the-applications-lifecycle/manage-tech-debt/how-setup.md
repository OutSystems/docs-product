<div class="info" markdown="1">

Architecture Dashboard is now AI Mentor Studio.

</div>

![Change language](images/select-language-ams.png)

</div>

## Log in for the first time {#first-login}

You can log into [AI Mentor Studio](https://aimentorstudio.outsystems.com/) with your **OutSystems account** or with your **IT user account**. 

<div class="info" markdown="1">

IT administrators can enforce IT User authentication in a specific environment. If you’re logging into an environment with IT User authentication activated, you can only log in with your IT user account.

</div>

### Log in with OutSystems account {#os-login}

If you log in with your **OutSystems account**, AI Mentor Studio shows you the following welcome screen:

![Welcome screen for OutSystems login](images/welcome-os-ams.png)

Select one of the options shown on the welcome screen:

[Register and set up my infrastructure](#register)
:   Choose this option if your infrastructure isn't registered in AI Mentor Studio. You must have a LifeTime administrator role. If you don't have a LifeTime administrator role, you won't have this option available and you must ask your administrator to complete the setup.    

[Associate my IT user](#associate-os-login)
:   Choose this option if your infrastructure is already registered in AI Mentor Studio.  

[Use your IT user account](#it-user-login)
:   Choose this option if your administrator activated IT user authentication for your infrastructure.  

### Log in with IT user account {#it-user-login}

If you log in with your **IT user account** and your infrastructure isn’t registered yet, AI Mentor Studio shows you the following welcome screen:

![Welcome screen for IT user login](images/welcome-it-user-ams.png)

AI Mentor Studio shows you the option:

[Register and set up my infrastructure](#register)
:   Choose this option if your infrastructure isn't registered in AI Mentor Studio. You must have a LifeTime administrator role. If you don't have a LifeTime administrator role, you won't have this option available and you must ask your administrator to complete the setup.  

If you log in with your **IT user account** and your infrastructure is already registered, you’ll have to [associate your IT user](#associate-it-user-login).

## Register and set up your infrastructure in AI Mentor Studio {#register}

### Prerequisites

Before registering and setting up your infrastructure in AI Mentor Studio, make sure that the following requirements are met:

* Your infrastructure is associated with an [OutSystems Edition](https://www.outsystems.com/pricing-and-editions/) that isn't the Free Edition. **You can't use a Personal Environment with AI Mentor Studio**.

* **LifeTime** is deployed in a **dedicated environment**.

* Your code analisys environment uses **Platform Server 11.18.1** or later.

* Your LifeTime environment uses **LifeTime Management Console 11.16.1** or later.
