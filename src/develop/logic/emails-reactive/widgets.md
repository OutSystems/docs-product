# Widgets in emails

OutSystems designed widgets to help you create lightweight emails that most email readers can open. When you edit an email, Service Studio shows the [available Email widgets](#widgets-available-in-emails) in the widgets toolbar.

<div class="info" markdown="1">

To use this feature, make sure you meet the [prerequisites](intro.md#prerequisites).

</div>

Use the Email widgets like you use the Screen widgets, with the following common differences designed to make the emails light and secure:

* Email widgets don't have features that require handling plenty of data. For example, Table in Emails doesn't show the pagination section.
* You can't use JavaScript and custom actions in Email widgets. Most email clients don't support JavaScript due to security concerns.
