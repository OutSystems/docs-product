# Stream logs to Datadog

This article explains how you can set up log streaming from OutSystems applications to the Datadog APM tool.

## Prerequisites

* Enabled [log separation](../../setup-infra-platform/setup/logging-db/logs-separation-cloud/intro.md).

* Installed Platform Server version 11.23.1 or higher.

* Installed LifeTime version 11.19.0 or higher.


## Set up log streaming

To set up the OutSystems log streaming service, using Datadog as the destination tool, follow these steps:

1. Get the Datadog API key.

1. Set up the [OpenTelemetry Collector](configure-collector.md) with Datadog as the exporter.

1. Get the OpenTelemetry Collector endpoint and authentication credentials.

Once you've completed these steps, go to LifeTime and [configure the log streaming service](lifetime-streaming.md).
