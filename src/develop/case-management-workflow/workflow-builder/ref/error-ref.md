## Publish errors

### Publish failed error - can't connect to the environment

This error may occur if your Internet connection is down or if your network requirements aren't accepting inbound connections from Workflow Builder.

Ensure your development environment allows inbound traffic from `https://workflowbuilder.outsystems.com` in port **443** to communicate with Workflow Builder. Refer to the [Workflow Builder network requirements](https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/11/Setting_Up_OutSystems/OutSystems_network_requirements#workflow-builder) for detailed information.

If your environment uses multiple database catalogs and schemas, you won't be able to publish the first version of an app.  
If you are an IT administrator, you can see a link provided to download the application package (.OAP). Click it, and then open and install the application package in Service Studio.
After that, you are able to publish new versions of the app in Workflow Builder.
