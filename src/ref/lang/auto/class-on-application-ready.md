# On Application Ready

<div class="info" markdown="1">

Applies to Mobile Apps and Reactive Web Apps only

</div>

The **On Application Ready** action runs when navigating to a module. Use **On Application Ready** to set up the app, for example, to initialize variables and mobile plugins.

**On Application Ready** action runs synchronously and blocks the screen render. This means that when navigating to a module for the first time, the accessed screen will render only after **On Application Ready** completes.

After the first execution, navigations between screens from the same module don't trigger **On Application Ready**. This includes navigating to other screens using 
[External Site](class-external-site.md) or [Destination](class-destination.md), navigating back to a previous screen, etc. However, if you navigate to a screen of a different module, the **On Application Ready** of that module is executed.

Note that **On Application Ready** is executed if the user types or refreshes the url of a screen directly in the browser address bar. This causes the corresponding module to reload.

To add the **On Application Ready** action to a Mobile or Reactive Web App do the following in Service Studio:

1. In the home module of your app, open the **Logic** tab.

1. Right-click the **Client Actions** node in the tree and select **Add System Event** > **On Application Ready**.
