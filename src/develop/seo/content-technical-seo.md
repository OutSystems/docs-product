# Content and technical SEO

SEO can be categorized into two major categories - content SEO and technical SEO. These categories are both equally important when it comes to your website ranking high in search engine result pages.

Content SEO refers to creating content that helps your web pages rank highly in search engines and includes everything related to the writing and structure of content on your website. While content SEO encompasses many different activities, the most important components of search optimization for websites are:

* Friendly URLs (configuring URLs in Reactive Web apps)

* URL prioritization (best practices around URL structure)

* Site rules

* Redirect rules

* Custom screen URLs

* Content related improvements (best practices around content)

* Dynamic page titles

Technical SEO refers to the way your website is set up to help search engines crawl, interpret, and index your site more effectively (to help improve organic rankings). It includes how your site is set up to provide a good user experience. While technical SEO encompasses many different activities, the most important components of search optimization for websites include the following:

* Improving crawlability

* Robots.txt files

* Sitemaps

Implementing both content and technical SEO strategies help ensure more page visits and a better user experience.  While content SEO can be seen as a marketing strategy to reach more users based on their interest in  the content, technical SEO refers to improvements on how your website works  to help search engines crawl and index your pages, as well as the experience it provides to the users.
