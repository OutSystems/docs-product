# Carousel

<div class="info" markdown="1">

Applies to Mobile Apps and Reactive Web Apps only

**This documentation is not valid for deprecated components.** To check if your component is deprecated and how to migrate old versions, see the [Patterns and Versions Overview](https://outsystemsui.outsystems.com/OutsystemsUiWebsite/MigrationOverview).

To find out what version of OutSystems UI you are using, see [OutSystems UI version](../../intro.md#outsystems-ui-version).

You can use the Carousel UI Pattern to display multiple items in a horizontal slide.  The Carousel Pattern optimizes screen space by displaying only a few images from a larger collection which you can view using the navigation controls.

<div class="info" markdown="1">

The Carousel Pattern is based on the Splide.js library (v3). For more information about the Carouselâ€™s behaviors and extensibility methods, see [Splide.js](https://splidejs.com/).

## How to use the Carousel UI Pattern

1. In Service Studio, in the Toolbox, search for `Carousel`.
  
     The Carousel widget is displayed.

    ![Image of the Carousel widget as displayed in the OutSystems Service Studio](images/carousel-widget-ss.png "Carousel Widget in Service Studio")

    If the UI widget doesn't display, it's because the dependency isn't added. This happens because the Remove unused references setting is enabled. To make the widget available in your app:

    1. In the Toolbox, click **Search in other modules**.

    1. In **Search in other Modules**, remove any spaces between words in your search text.
    
    1. Select the widget you want to add from the **OutSystemsUI** module, and click **Add Dependency**. 
    
    1. In the Toolbox, search for the widget again.

1. From the Toolbox, drag the Carousel widget into the Main Content area of your application's screen. 

    ![Step-by-step illustration of dragging the Carousel widget into the Main Content area of an application's screen](images/carousel-dragwidget-ss.png "Dragging Carousel Widget to the Screen")

    By default, the Carousel pattern contains a **CarouselItems** placeholder with a **List** widget and **Image** widget. If you want a Carousel with static images, you can remove the **List** widget and add your images inside the **CarouselItems** placeholder.

1. Add your content to the **Carousel Items** placeholder. 

    In this example, the List is deleted and 3 Image widgets are added.  

    ![Example of adding three Image widgets to the Carousel Items placeholder in Service Studio](images/carousel-addimages-ss.png "Adding Image Widgets to Carousel") 

1. Select the **Image** widget, and on the **Properties** tab, from the **Image** drop-down, select or import the image you want in the Carousel. 

    **Note:** In this example, the image Type is set to Local image. You can also add External and Binary Data images. In this example, the image property Type is set to **Local** image. You can also add [External and Binary Data](../../../image/display-image.md) images.   

    ![Screenshot showing how to set the image type for images in the Carousel UI Pattern](images/carousel-imagetype-ss.png "Setting Image Type in Carousel")   

1. Repeat step 4 for each of the images in the Carousel. 

1. You can configure the Carousel by selecting the pattern, and on the **Properties** tab, set the relevant (optional) properties, for example, **Navigation** or **ItemsPerSlide**.For more configurations, expand the **OptionalConfigs** property.

    ![Image depicting the process of setting optional properties for the Carousel UI Pattern](images/carousel-properties-ss.png "Carousel Properties Configuration")  

After following these steps and publishing the module, you can test the pattern in your app.
