# The Asset cannot contain SOAP

SOAP is an integration technology that has seen a significant reduction in its use over time. so at this point, ODC does not support SOAP (consumption or exposure).

## How to solve

If you want to proceed with the migration of other ODC assets without SOAP, follow the steps in the following sections.

### SOAP Expose

Consider replacing SOAP Expose with REST Expose.

### SOAP Consume

Consider the following options:

* Use an integration platform such as Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) or an API Gateway Management that can translate between different systems. Use REST on the OutSystems side to connect to the integration platform and continue to use SOAP between the integration platform and the external system.

* In ODC, implement the SOAP Consume using [ODC custom code](https://success.outsystems.com/documentation/outsystems_developer_cloud/building_apps/extend_your_apps_with_external_logic_using_custom_code/supporting_soap_in_odc/).
If you have access to the Migration Kit, ensure the O11 modules with findings for this code pattern aren't mapped to any ODC Assets. Either move the module with SOAP Consume to an app that isn't mapped to an ODC Asset, or replace the SOAP Consume usage with a placeholder action that you can later replace in ODC.
