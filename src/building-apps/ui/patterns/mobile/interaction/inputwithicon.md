# Input with Icon

<div class="info" markdown="1">

Applies to Mobile Apps and Reactive Web Apps only

</div>

You can use the Input with Icon UI Pattern to allow the end user input data with the help of a hint in the form of an icon.

The Input with Icon UI Pattern includes an icon and placeholder text that supports the user when entering data. Is assists the user's comprehension by providing an example of the type of input required.

**How to use the Input with Icon**

1. In Service Studio, in the Toolbox, search for `Input with Icon`.

    The Input with Icon widget is displayed.

    If the UI widget doesn't display, it's because the dependency isn't added. This happens because the Remove unused references setting is enabled. To make the widget available in your app:

    1. In the Toolbox, click **Search in other modules**.

    1. In **Search in other Modules**, remove any spaces between words in your search text.
    
    1. Select the widget you want to add from the **OutSystemsUI** module, and click **Add Dependency**. 
    
    1. In the Toolbox, search for the widget again.

1. From the Toolbox, drag the Input with Icon widget into the Main Content area of your application's screen.

    By default, the Input with Icon widget contains Icon and Input widgets.

1. Select the Input widget, and on the **Properties** tab, from the **Variable** drop-down, select **New Local Variable**.

1. Enter a name for variable. In this example we enter `Username` and set the **Data Type** property to Text.

    This variable can be reused throughout your app.

1. Select the Input widget again, and on the **Properties** tab, in the **Prompt** property, enter the text you want displayed in the input box that describes the expected value. In this example, we enter `Username`.

    ![Screenshot of the Properties tab where the Prompt property of the Input widget is set to 'Username'](images/inputwithicon-5-ss.png "Configuring the Input Widget Prompt")

1. To change the icon, select the Icon widget, and from the **Icon** drop-down, select the icon you want to display in the input box. In this example, we select the user icon.

1. You can change the Input with Icon's look and feel by setting the (optional) properties on the **Property** tab.

After following these steps and publishing the module, you can test the pattern in your app.

## Properties
