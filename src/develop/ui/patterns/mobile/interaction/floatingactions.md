# Floating Actions

You can use the Floating Actions UI Pattern to display an action that floats in the bottom right corner of the screen, providing access to a set of additional actions.

Use the Floating Action UI Pattern to show the primary action on a screen. Choose actions such as create, share, explore and so on. Avoid actions such as delete, archive or an alert. Exclude limited actions such as cut-and-paste text or actions that should be in a toolbar.

**How to use the Floating Actions UI Pattern**

1. In Service Studio, in the Toolbox, search for `Floating Actions`.

    The Floating Actions widget is displayed.

    ![](<images/floatingactions-1-ss.png>)

1. From the Toolbox, drag the Floating Actions widget into the Main Content area of your application's screen.

    ![](<images/floatingactions-2-ss.png>)

    By default, the Floating Actions widget contains a Button placeholder (with an icon) and an Items placeholder with 3 Floating Actions Item widgets (each containing a Label and Item placeholder). You can add or delete the Floating Actions Item widgets as required.

1. Add the relevant content to the placeholders.

    In this example, we add text to the Label placeholders and a linked icons to the Item placeholders.  

    ![](<images/floatingactions-3-ss.png>)

After following these steps and publishing the module, you can test the pattern in your app.
