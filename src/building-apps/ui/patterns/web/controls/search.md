# Search

<div class="info" markdown="1">

Applies only to Traditional Web Apps.

</div>

You can use the Search UI Pattern to provide users with a search field.

**How to use the Search UI Pattern**

1. In Service Studio, in the Toolbox, search for `Search`.

    The Search widget is displayed.

    ![Screenshot of the Search widget in the Service Studio toolbox](images/search-1-ss.png "Search Widget in Service Studio")

    If the UI widget doesn't display, it's because the dependency isn't added. This happens because the Remove unused references setting is enabled. To make the widget available in your app:

    1. In the Toolbox, click **Search in other modules**.

    1. In **Search in other Modules**, remove any spaces between words in your search text.
    
    1. Select the widget you want to add from the **OutSystemsUIWeb** module, and click **Add Dependency**. 
    
    1. In the Toolbox, search for the widget again.

1. From the Toolbox, drag the Search widget into the Main Content area of your application's screen.

    By default, the Search widget contains Icon, Input, and Actions placeholders.

1. Create a local variable by right-clicking on your screen name and selecting **Add Local Variable**.

1. Enter a name for the variable. In this example, we enter ``SearchText``.

After following these steps and publishing the module, you can test the pattern in your app.
