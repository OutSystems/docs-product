# OutSystems system requirements

<div class="info" markdown="1">

This article applies to: **OutSystems 11**&#8195;&#8195;Other versions available: [10](https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/10/Setting_Up_OutSystems/OutSystems_system_requirements)&#8195;[9.1](https://www.outsystems.com/Downloads/ScreenDetails.aspx?MajorVersion=9&ReleaseId=18346&ComponentName=Platform+Server)&#8195;[9.0](https://www.outsystems.com/Downloads/ScreenDetails.aspx?MajorVersion=9&ReleaseId=19270&ComponentName=Platform+Server)

</div>

Before installing OutSystems on-premises, check if your set up meets the hardware and software requirements listed in this article. To start the installation, refer to [Setting Up OutSystems](intro.md).

## Platform server

The following are the requirements for installing the Platform Server in your data center.

### Hardware (minimum requirements)

* Dual-core processor
* 4 GB of RAM
* 80 GB of free disk space

### Operating system

* Microsoft Windows Server 2022 (Standard Edition or higher edition), since Platform Server 11.20.0<sup>1</sup>
* Microsoft Windows Server 2019 (Standard Edition or higher edition), since Platform Server Release Jul.2019
* Microsoft Windows Server 2016 (Standard Edition or higher edition)

OutSystems only supports Windows editions that are [supported by Microsoft](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/search).

<sup>1</sup> When installing the Platform Server on Windows Server 2022, or upgrading an existing installation to Windows Server 2022, consider increasing the CPU and memory of the machines as the Operating System itself requires more resources.


The supported Operating System configurations must be deployed on bare metal or hardware virtualization technologies (for example, VMware or KVM).

Future revisions of OutSystems may require the installation of an update within the major versions mentioned in the previous list.

### Application server

* Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) 10.0 or higher configured with a valid SSL certificate emitted by a public certificate authority. The SSL Certificate can alternatively be installed at a load balancer or reverse proxy level in [end-to-end SSL and SSL offloading](https://success.outsystems.com/documentation/how_to_guides/infrastructure/using_outsystems_in_reverse_proxy_scenarios/outsystems_configurations_in_reverse_proxy_scenarios/#ssl-offloading) configurations.

### Database management system

Use the same type of database engine for all the 3 databases in Platform Server (platform and apps, logs, session). OutSystems does not support a combination of database engines. For example, you can't use SQL Server for the platform database and Azure SQL database for the logs/session databases (or any other combination).

* Microsoft SQL Server 2019 or higher, with compatibility level 150, since Platform Server 11.12.0 <sup>1</sup>
* Microsoft SQL Server 2017 (Web Edition or higher edition)<sup>1</sup>
* Microsoft SQL Server 2016 (Web Edition or higher edition)<sup>1</sup>
* Microsoft SQL Server 2014 (Web Edition or higher edition)<sup>1</sup>
* Azure SQL Database V12
* Oracle 19c (Standard Edition or Enterprise Edition), since Platform Server 11 – Release Oct.2019 CP3
* Oracle 18c (Standard Edition or Enterprise Edition), since Platform Server 11 – Release Oct.2019 CP2
* Oracle 12c (12.1 or 12.2, Standard Edition or Enterprise Edition)

<sup>1</sup> Developer and Express editions of Microsoft SQL Server (any version) aren't supported.

Future revisions of OutSystems may require the installation of an update within the major versions mentioned in the previous list.

Apart from standard Oracle Database setups, OutSystems platform 8.0 and onwards works with [Oracle Exadata Database Machines](http://www.oracle.com/us/products/database/exadata/overview/index.html) running with Oracle Linux 5.5 or higher.

### Additional software requirements

* Microsoft .NET Framework 4.8 (supported since Platform Server 11 – Release Oct.2019 CP2) or Microsoft .NET Framework 4.7.2
* Microsoft Build Tools 2015
* .NET Runtime & Hosting Bundle for Windows in the following versions, depending on the Platform Server version:
    * .NET 8.0 Runtime & Hosting Bundle for Windows for Platform Server version 11.27.0 or newer
    * .NET 6.0 Runtime & Hosting Bundle for Windows for Platform Server versions between 11.17.1 and 11.26.0
    * .NET 3.1 Runtime & Hosting Bundle for Windows for Platform Server versions between 11.12.2 and 11.17.0
    * .NET 2.1 Runtime & Hosting Bundle for Windows for Platform Server versions between 11.12.1 and 11.0.539.0 (Release Jul.2019 CP1)
    * .NET 2.0 Runtime & Hosting Bundle for Windows for Platform Server version 11.0.528.0 (Release Jul.2019) and older
* Microsoft Visual C++ 2015-2022 Redistributable (x64) (only for Platform Server version 11.21.0 or above)

Future revisions of OutSystems may require the installation of an update within the major versions mentioned in the previous list.

## Cache invalidation service

RabbitMQ Server and Erlang versions numbers follow the format: Major.Minor.Patch. OutSystems Platform Server versions require minimum Patch versions of RabbitMQ Server and Erlang.

You can upgrade to the latest Patch of RabbitMQ Server, and the latest Minor of Erlang provided that:

* The Patch RabbitMQ Server is higher than the one listed for the Platform Server version. For example, you can upgrade to RabbitMQ Server 3.10.25 for environments using Platform Server 11.19.0.
* The Minor version of Erlang is higher than the one listed for the Platform Server version. For example, you can upgrade Erlang version to 25.2 for environments using Platform Server 11.19.0.
* You keep the combination with the Erlang compliant with the [official documentation](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html). For example, when upgrading for RabbitMQ Server 3.10.25 you can upgrade Erlang to 25.2

The following are the minimum Patch versions of RabbitMQ Server and Erlang per Platform Server version:

* For Platform Server 11.27.0 and higher: RabbitMQ Server 3.13.0 and Erlang version 26.2.2
* For Platform Server 11.19.0 and higher: RabbitMQ Server 3.10.14 and Erlang version 25.1.2
* From Platform Server 11.15.0 to 11.18.1: RabbitMQ Server 3.9.11 and Erlang version 24.2
* From Platform Server 11.13.2 to 11.14.1: RabbitMQ Server 3.8.21 and Erlang version 23.2
* From Platform Server 11.9.0 to 11.13.1: RabbitMQ Server 3.8.3 and Erlang version 22.3
* For Platform Server 11.8.2 and lower: RabbitMQ Server 3.7.7 and Erlang version 20.3

During Platform Server installation, OutSystems provides a script that simplifies the local installation of these two components (RabbitMQ Server and Erlang). Alternatively, you can use an existing RabbitMQ Server and Erlang installation if it fulfills the same version requirements.

## Amazon EC2 considerations

OutSystems can run on Amazon EC2 instances. Each instance must fulfill the following requirements:

* The EC2Config service must be running

For more information on how to enable this service, refer to [Amazon EC2Config service documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/ec2config-service.html).

## Amazon RDS considerations

OutSystems supports Microsoft SQL Server 2019 and compatibility level 150 (since Platform Server 11.12.0), Microsoft SQL Server 2016, Microsoft SQL Server 2017, Oracle 12c, Oracle 18c, and Oracle 19c on Amazon RDS. The database instance class must fulfill the following requirements:

* 1 vCPU (virtual central processing unit) or higher
* 1 ECU (EC2 Compute Unit) or higher
* 3.75 GiB of memory or higher
* "Moderate" network performance or higher

Example of a DB instance class fulfilling these requirements: "db.t2.medium".

Oracle 18c on Amazon RDS is supported since Platform Server 11 – Release Oct.2019 CP2.
Oracle 19c on Amazon RDS is supported since Platform Server 11 – Release Oct.2019 CP3.

For more information on the available DB instance classes, refer to [Amazon's DB Instance Class](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.DBInstanceClass.html).To learn more about Amazon RDS limitations, refer to [Amazon RDS System Requirements](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html).

## Microsoft Azure considerations

OutSystems supports Microsoft Azure SQL Database V12 with the following considerations:

* The database service tier must be at least "S3".
* The MDC (Multiple Database Catalogs) feature isn't supported.
* Connecting to Azure SQL database using Windows authentication isn't supported.
* Private endpoints aren't supported, due to a limitation on how Microsoft implements them.
* Customizing the timezone from UTC isn't supported in Azure SQL database.

OutSystems also supports SQL Server running on an Azure virtual machine.
