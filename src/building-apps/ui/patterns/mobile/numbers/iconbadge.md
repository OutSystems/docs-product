# Icon Badge

<div class="info" markdown="1">

Applies to Mobile Apps and Reactive Web Apps only

</div>

You can use the Icon Badge UI Pattern to display numerical information as a notification. For example, the Icon Badge UI pattern is frequently used to notify users about the number of unread emails, unopened messages, or new tasks they may have.

**How to use the Icon Badge UI Pattern**

The following example demonstrates how you can display the number of registered users on your platform.

1. In Service Studio, in the Toolbox, search for `Icon Badge`.

    The Icon Badge widget is displayed.

    ![Service Studio displaying the Icon Badge widget in the toolbox](images/iconbadge-2-ss.png "Icon Badge Widget in Service Studio")

    If the UI widget doesn't display, it's because the dependency isn't added. This happens because the Remove unused references setting is enabled. To make the widget available in your app:

    1. In the Toolbox, click **Search in other modules**.

    1. In **Search in other Modules**, remove any spaces between words in your search text.
    
    1. Select the widget you want to add from the **OutSystemsUI** module, and click **Add Dependency**. 
    
    1. In the Toolbox, search for the widget again.

1. From the Toolbox, drag the Icon Badge widget into the Main Content area of your application's screen.

    ![Dragging the Icon Badge widget into the Main Content area of an application screen](images/iconbadge-3-ss.png "Dragging Icon Badge Widget")

    By default, the Icon Badge contains an Icon placeholder with a pre-existing icon.

1. To create an aggregate (in this example to retrieve all the users on the platform), right-click the screen name and select **Fetch Data from Database**.

    ![Creating an aggregate to fetch data from the database](images/iconbadge-4-ss.png "Creating an Aggregate")

1. To add a database entity, click the screen, and from the **Select Source** pop-up, select the relevant entity and click **OK**. In this example, we select the **User** entity.

    The aggregate **GetUsers** is created.

    ![The GetUsers aggregate displayed after creation](images/iconbadge-6-ss.png "Aggregate GetUsers Created")

1. To reopen your screen, select the **Interface** tab, and double-click on your screen name.

1. Select the Icon Badge widget, and on the **Properties** tab, from the **Number** drop-down, select **Expression Editor**, and in the Expression Editor enter the following expression and click **Done**.

    `GetUsers.Count`

    ![Setting the Number property of the Icon Badge widget to display user count](images/iconbadge-7-ss.png "Setting the Number Property")

    The **Number** property is now set to display the Count property of the Aggregate you created earlier, which gets and displays the number of users on your platform.

1. On the **Properties** tab, you can customize the Icon Badge's look and feel by setting any of the optional properties, for example, the color.

After following these steps and publishing the module, you can test the pattern in your app.
