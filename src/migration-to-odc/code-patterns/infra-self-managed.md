# Self-managed infrastructure

A [self-managed](../../setup-infra-platform/setup/intro.md#self-managed) OutSystems infrastructure is located on the customerâ€™s data center and is managed by the customer.

## How to solve

<div class="info" markdown="1">

If you are only preparing for the conversion, at present, OutSystems recommends that you focus on making your code and data ready for ODC. OutSystems is working on conversion automation capabilities for self-managed infrastructures.

</div>

This pattern isn't supported yet.

Currently, O11 conversion to ODC is only supported for [OutSystems 11 Cloud](../../setup-infra-platform/setup/intro.md#cloud) infrastructures.
