# Input with Icon

<div class="info" markdown="1">

Applies only to Traditional Web Apps.

</div>

You can use the Input with Icon UI Pattern to allow the end user input data with the help of a hint in the form of an icon.

The Input with Icon UI Pattern includes an icon and placeholder text that supports the user when entering data. Is assists the user's comprehension by providing an example of the type of input required.

**How to use the Input with Icon**

1. In Service Studio, in the Toolbox, search for `Input with Icon`.

    The Input with Icon widget is displayed.

    If the UI widget doesn't display, it's because the dependency isn't added. This happens because the Remove unused references setting is enabled. To make the widget available in your app:

    1. In the Toolbox, click **Search in other modules**.

    1. In **Search in other Modules**, remove any spaces between words in your search text.
    
    1. Select the widget you want to add from the **OutSystemsUIWeb** module, and click **Add Dependency**. 
    
    1. In the Toolbox, search for the widget again.

1. From the Toolbox, drag the Input with Icon widget into the Main Content area of your application's screen.
