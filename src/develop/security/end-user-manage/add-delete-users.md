If you use an external authentication method (e.g., Active Directory or SAML 2.0) to authenticate end users, you do not need to create the users manually. Instead, they will be automatically created in the OutSystems database on the first login.  
Check [End Users Authentication](end-user-authentication/intro.md) for more information on external authentication methods.

To create a new end user for your applications, click **Create a new User** and fill in the details. After the user is created, you’ll be redirected to the user detail page where you can edit the user’s details, groups and roles.

## Deactivate an existing end user { #deactivate }

To deactivate an end user, access the user detail page and then click **Set as Inactive**. 

In the **Users** tab, click **Inactive Users** to view the list of users who are deactivated.  
To reactivate a user, enter the user details and click **Set as Active**.

## Delete an existing end user { #delete }

To permanently delete an end user, click **Edit this User** on the user detail screen and select **Delete this User**.
