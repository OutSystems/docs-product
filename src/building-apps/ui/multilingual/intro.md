# Translating the app UI

Applies only to Traditional Web Apps.

These instructions are for translating Traditional Web Apps only. For Reactive Web and Mobile Apps see [Multilingual apps](../multilingual-tp/intro.md).

The UI of an application is designed for a particular language. This is called the default language, and it's in this language that the application is executed by default. You may have your application translated and executed in other languages, making it a multilingual application with a multilingual UI.

Use the OutSystems built-in mechanisms to [localize your Traditional Web Applications](multilingual-web.md).
