# Handle the Submitted Feedback

When you enable users to send feedback for your applications, the submitted feedback will be accessible in the App Feedback application:

1. Open the LifeTime console.

1. In the Applications section, select "App Feedback" option in the drop-down menu next to the environment where you want to enable user feedback. This will open the App Feedback application in that environment:

1. Sign in with the credentials of an end user account that has Administrator or FeedbackManager permissions.

1. In the Feedback section, you find the feedback submitted for each application:

<div class="info" markdown="1">

If you don't have LifeTime installed, you can access directly to the App Feedback application of your environment by typing `https://<your environment>/ECT_Provider` in your browser.  

</div>

Opening each submitted feedback, you'll find the following information:

* The screenshot of the feedback on the screen
* The status of the feedback
* The information about who submitted the feedback and when
* The feedback: in plain text or recorded voice
* The operating system
* The screen resolution
