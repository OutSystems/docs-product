# OutSystems UI Pattern extensibility

<div class="info" markdown="1">

This article refers to the latest version of each UI Pattern only. Some deprecated patterns use different providers and a different extensibility solution through the **AdvancedFormat** parameter.

</div>

Some of  OutSystems UI Patterns are based on external providers. Although these providers have many different extensibility options available, OutSystems only offers a curated list of them using input parameters and client actions. 

However, you can access all of the extensibility options offered by the providers by using the following OutSystems extensibility features:

* [Provider client actions](ext-provider-client-actions.md)
* [Provider instance and JavaScript](ext-provider-instance-java.md)

The following table shows the list of OutSystems UI Patterns that use external providers:
