# Pass Data Between Screens With Input Parameters

Some screens receive information that defines the data shown on that screen. For instance, a screen showing the profile of a user requires information about which user to display. In OutSystems, we use Input Parameters to pass information between screens.

To pass information to a screen do the following:

1. Right-click the screen on the Elements Tree and choose 'Add Input Parameter'.
1. Define the name and data type of the new input parameter. 
1. Use the input parameter to define or filter the information shown on the screen. 
1. When navigating to this screen set the value of the input parameter.
