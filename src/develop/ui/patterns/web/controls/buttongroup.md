# Button Group

<div class="info" markdown="1">

Applies only to Traditional Web Apps.

</div>

You can use the Button Group UI Pattern to display radio button choices to the user. This pattern is ideal when you have between two to four options. To show a larger number of options, consider using a the Dropdown UI Pattern.

**How to use the Button Group UI Pattern**

1. In Service Studio, in the Toolbox, search for `Button Group`.

    The Button Group widget is displayed.

    ![](<images/buttongroup-image-1.png>)

    If the UI widget doesn't display, it's because the dependency isn't added. This happens because the Remove unused references setting is enabled. To make the widget available in your app:

    1. In the Toolbox, click **Search in other modules**.

    1. In **Search in other Modules**, remove any spaces between words in your search text.
    
    1. Select the widget you want to add from the **OutSystemsUIWeb** module, and click **Add Dependency**. 
    
    1. In the Toolbox, search for the widget again.

1. From the Toolbox, drag the Button Group widget into the Main Content area of your application's screen.

     ![](<images/buttongroup-image-2.png>)

    By default, the pattern contains 3 Button Group Items. You can add or delete as many Button Group Items as required.

1. From the Widget Tree, select the **radio-button** element, and on the **Properties** tab, set the **Variable** and **Value** properties. 

    ![](<images/buttongroup-image-3.png>)

1. Repeat step 3 for each of the **radio-button** elements.

1. Change the **Label** text for each of the Button Group Items.

See [Variables](../../../../../ref/data/handling-data/variables/intro.md) for more infomation on variables.
