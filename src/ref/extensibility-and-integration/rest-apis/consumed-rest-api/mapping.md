# Mapping REST Data Types to OutSystems Data Types

When [consuming REST API Methods](<../../../../extensibility-and-integration/rest/consume-rest-apis/consume-a-rest-api.md>) in your module, OutSystems automatically generates the Structures for the Request and Response from the example you provide for them and maps the attributes into OutSystems Data Types as follows:

| JSON example                                                                         | OutSystems Data Type | Comments                                                                                                                                                |

| `{"quantity": 123456789}`                                                            | Long Integer         | Highest value: 2^63-1                                                                                                                                   |

| `{"createdon": "2014-12-31T23:59:59+01:00", "shippedon": "2015-01-01T19:00:00.256"}` | Date Time            | If the ISO date contains information about the time zone, it's automatically converted to the local time of the server, with daylight savings applied. |
| `{"scheduledstart": "/Date(1388534400000)/"}`                                        | Date Time            | WCF format                                                                                                                                              |
| `{"createdon": "2014-12-24"}`                                                        | Date                 | Format: YYYY-MM-DD                                                                                                                                      |
| `{"canupdate": true}`                                                                | Boolean              |                                                                                                                                                         |
| `{"image-png": "data:image/png;base64,sample-base64-data"}`                          | Binary               | The platform sends binary data as base64, and converts received base64 to binary when the attribute is set to binary.                                       |
| `{"name": "Christine Sharp"}`                                                        | Text                 |

Data that can't be converted to one of the above data types is converted to
Text.
