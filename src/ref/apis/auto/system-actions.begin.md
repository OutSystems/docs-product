OutSystems provides a set of **System Actions** that you can use when designing the Actions to define the business rules of your application.

Run System Actions the same way as any other Action in your module. System Actions are available in the Logic tab, under the System module within the **Server Actions** folder.

If you are developing a mobile app, along with the System Actions available at the server side, OutSystems provides you a set of System Actions to run at the client side. These **Client Actions** are available under the System module within the **Client Actions** folder.

Only a subset of the System Actions is added by default to your module. You can add other System Actions at any time by adding new dependencies from the System module.

Similarly to the Actions you design in your module, some Systems Actions are **defined as functions**, which you can use also within Expressions. They are available in the **User Functions** folder within the Scope Tree of the Expression Editor.
