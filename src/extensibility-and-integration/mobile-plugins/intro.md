# Mobile Plugins

<div class="info" markdown="1">

Applies only to Mobile Apps.

</div>

Plugins provide important functionalities to native mobile apps, letting you use many of the hardware capabilities of mobile devices. You can add notifications, use camera or global positioning services, read QR codes, and more.

## The list of supported mobile plugins

The table shows the OutSystems-supported mobile plugins that you can find in the Forge repository. Some of them are already supported when distributing your app as a Progressive Web App (PWA).

You may also create mobile plugins by [wrapping an Apache Cordova plugin into a module](<using-cordova-plugins.md>).

### Notes

When working with the plugins:

* Use the plugin that supports iOS or Android, depending on your target platform. The app generation fails if you use a plugin that isn't supported on the target platform.
* Each time you add, remove, or modify the plugin in an app, OutSystems [rebuilds the native shell](<../../deliver-mobile/mobile-app-update-scenarios.md#Situations_When_the_User_Must_Install_a_New_Build>) which you then have to distribute to the end users for installation.
* [Include the plugin license](<../../deliver-mobile/compliance-with-third-party-licenses.md#Include_the_Third_Party_Licenses_Used_by_Plug-ins_or_Components>) in your app to respect the license agreements of that plugin. These license agreements are usually placed in the About page of the app that uses them.

## Adding plugins

The plugins are available from the Forge repository. To use a plugin in your app, you need to [install the plugin](#installing-a-plugin) and [add the plugin elements to your module](#referencing-a-plugin).

### Installing a plugin

To install a supported plugin from Forge:

1. Find the plugin you want to use in the [list of supported mobile plugins](#the-list-of-supported-mobile-plugins).

1. Click the plugin name in the column **Plugin**. The Forge page opens.

1. In the Forge plugin page, click **INSTALL** and follow the instructions to install the plugin and optionally the demo app that comes with the plugin.

    ![Install plugin from Forge](images/forge-install.png?width=700)

1. Once the installation finishes, [reference the plugin in your module](#referencing-a-plugin).

<div class="info" markdown="1">

Find the plugin documentation in the table of content next to this page, or check out the **Documentation** tab in the plugin Forge page.

</div>

### Referencing a plugin

Referencing an [installed plugin](#installing-a-plugin) lets you use the plugin functionalities in the app logic. Follow these steps to reference a mobile plugin:

1. In Service Studio, open **Manage Dependencies** (**Ctrl+Q**).

1. Enter the plugin name in the **Search producers** field. If the plugin name is **Camera Plugin**, try searching for `CameraPlugin`.

1. In the results, in the producers list, select the plugin.

1. In the plugin elements, in the public elements list, select the elements you want to use in your app. If you're unsure which elements to select, select all by selecting the plugin handle at the top of the list.

    ![Manage Dependencies dialog with all elements selected](images/manage-dependencies-plugin-ss.png?width=700)

1. Click **Apply** to confirm adding the plugin to the app.

1. Verify Service Studio added the plugin elements. Most plugins have logic in **Logic** > **Client Actions** > **plugin handle**. Some plugins come with user interface elements that you can find in **Interface** > **UI Flows** > **plugin handle**.

## Built-in plugins

All mobile apps generated by OutSystems include a native shell with the following built-in plugins that are used internally, handling a variety of housekeeping and infrastructure tasks.

Plugin | Description
-------|-----------------
OS Cache       | Lets your application to run offline or with bad network conditions.
OS Cordova Loader | Loads the Cordova engine on your app.
OS Deeplinks   | Opens hyperlinks to specific screens of your app.
OS DB Upgrader | Manages the local storage of your app.
OS Manifest    | Provides a parser for the app manifest.
OS Pre-Bundle  | Handles the content of the app pre-bundled resources.
OS Security    | Provides the APIs for the security layer.
Mobile AppFeedback | Enables the user to invoke App Feedback for submitting feedback about the app.
NetworkStatus  | Lets your app know when the device is online/offline and informs of the type of network available (for example, WiFi, 3G, 4G).

While you may see the names of these built-in plugins in the [native mobile shell logs](<../../managing-the-applications-lifecycle/monitor-and-troubleshoot/monitoring-an-environment.md>) they're not user-configurable. The only exception is [Mobile AppFeedback](<../../managing-the-applications-lifecycle/app-feedback/user-feedback-enable.md>), which is present in the native shell if you enable the App Feedback feature.
