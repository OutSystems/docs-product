# Section Index

You can use the Section Index UI Pattern to organize the content of a screen, enabling quick navigation within the page.

**How to use the Section Index UI Pattern**

1. In Service Studio, from the Toolbox, search for and drag the Section widget into the Main Content area of your application's screen.

    ![](<images/sectionindex-5-ss.png>)

1. Add as many sections as you require and add the relevant content. In this example we add text and images.

    ![](<images/sectionindex-1-ss.png>)

1. From the Toolbox, drag the Section Index widget into the Main Content area of your application's screen.

    ![](<images/sectionindex-2-ss.png>)

    A link is automatically created to every section you have on the screen. The name of the link is based on the text you entered in the **Title** placeholder of each section. In the following example, the links are set to the In-Ear Audio Black, In-Ear Audio Sport Grey etc., sections that we added earlier.

    ![](<images/sectionindex-3-ss.png>)

After following these steps and publishing the module, you can test the pattern in your app.

## Properties

| **Property** |  **Description** |
|---|---|
| IsSmooth (Boolean): Optional  |  If True, the navigation to the destination is animated. If False, the navigation is instant. This is the default. |
| IsFixed (Text): Optional  | If True, the Section Index Pattern is always in the same position on the screen. This is the default. If False, the Section Index Pattern scrolls with the page content. |
| TopPosition (Integer): Optional  |  Distance in pixels from the top of the page to the first item in the section index.  |
| ExtendedClass (Text): Optional | Add custom style classes to the Section Index UI Pattern. You define your [custom style classes](../../../../../develop/ui/look-feel/css.md) in your application using CSS. <p>Examples <ul><li>_Blank_ - No custom styles are added (default value).</li><li>_''myclass''_ - Adds the _myclass_ style to the Section Index UI styles being applied.</li><li>_''myclass1'' ''myclass2''_ - Adds the _myclass1_ and _myclass2_ styles to the Section Index UI styles being applied.</li></ul></p> |
  
## Additional notes

Remember to use the **Title** placeholder in the Section Index pattern as this defines the text for each Section Index link.

## Device compatibility

In Internet Explorer, `position: fixed` is used instead of `position sticky` as the latter is unsupported.

## Compatibility with other patterns

This UI pattern only works with the Section Pattern in the same screen.
