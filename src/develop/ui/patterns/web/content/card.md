# Card

You can use the Cards UI Pattern to group small pieces of information and highlight them on the screen. The information is grouped into a small block that is easily noticeable on-screen.

**How to use the Card UI Pattern**

1. In Service Studio, in the Toolbox, search for `Card`.

    The Card widget is displayed.

    ![](<images/card-2-ss.png>)

1. From the Toolbox, drag the Card widget into the Main Content area of your application's screen.

    ![](<images/card-3-ss.png>)

1. Add your content to the placeholder. In this example we add some text.

    ![](<images/card-4-ss.png>)

After following these steps and publishing the module, you can test the pattern in your app.
