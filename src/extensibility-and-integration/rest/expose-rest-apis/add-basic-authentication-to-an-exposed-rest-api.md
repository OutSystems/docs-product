# Add Basic Authentication to an Exposed REST API

## Basic authentication

Basic authentication is a simple authentication scheme built into the HTTP protocol. The client sends HTTP requests with the "Authorization" header containing the word "Basic", a space character, and a "username:password" string encoded in Base64.

For example, to authorize the user "demo" with password "p@55w0rd" the client sends:

    Authorization: Basic ZGVtbzpwQDU1dzByZA==

In this example, the `ZGVtbzpwQDU1dzByZA==` string results from encoding the string `demo:p@55w0rd` in Base64.

**Note:** Because Base64 is easily decoded, you should only use basic authentication together with other security mechanisms such as **HTTPS/SSL**.

To learn more about HTTP authentication, check for example the MDN Web Docs on [HTTP authentication](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Authentication).

## Basic authentication in OutSystems REST APIs

OutSystems allows you to add basic authentication to the requests made to the REST APIs you are exposing.

For that, do the following:

1. In the **Logic** tab, open the **Integrations** folder.

1. Select the exposed REST API you want to change and set its "Authentication" property to `Basic`.

As a result, OutSystems creates the "OnAuthentication" action in your REST API to handle basic authentication with:

* The "Username" and "Password" input parameters holding the credentials passed in the request (they're automatically decoded from the "Authorization" HTTP header)
* The "User_Login" action to validate the credentials and identify the user

All methods in the REST API now require Basic Authentication. Manage user credentials in your end user management application (by default, the [Users application](../../../develop/security/end-user-manage/accessing-users.md)).

In the example above, OutSystems logs in the user and creates a session during the request. The GetUserId() function returns the user ID and you can call the CheckRole built-in functions, allowing you to create logic based on the user and the roles assigned to the user.
