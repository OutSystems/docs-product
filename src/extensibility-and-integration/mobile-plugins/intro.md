# Mobile Plugins

Plugins provide crucial functionality to mobile apps, allowing developers to fully exploit the capabilities of mobile devices, offering users such features as notifications, camera functions, QC code readers, and global positioning services.

All mobile apps generated by OutSystems include a native shell with the following built-in plugins that are used internally, handling a variety of housekeeping and infrastructure tasks.

Plugin | Description
-------|-----------------
OS Cache       | Allows your application to run offline or with bad network conditions.
OS Cordova Loader | Loads the Cordova engine on your app.
OS Deeplinks   | Allows opening hyperlinks to specific screens of your app.
OS DB Upgrader | Manages the local storage of your app.
OS Manifest    | Provides a parser for the app manifest.
OS Pre-Bundle  | Handles the content of pre-bundled resources on your app.
OS Security    | Provides the required APIs for the security layer.
NetworkStatus  | Allows your application to know when the device is online/offline and the type of network available (for example, WiFi, 3G, 4G).
Mobile AppFeedback | Enables the user to invoke App Feedback for submitting feedback about the app.

 While you may see the names of these built-in plugins in the [native mobile shell logs](<../../managing-the-applications-lifecycle/monitor-and-troubleshoot/monitoring-an-environment.md>) they are not user-configurable. The only exception is [Mobile AppFeedback](<../../managing-the-applications-lifecycle/app-feedback/user-feedback-enable.md>), which is present in the native shell if the App Feedback feature is enabled.
 
## Using a mobile plugin

The table below shows OutSystems-supported moblie plugins that you can find [on the Forge](<https://www.outsystems.com/forge/>). Some of them are already supported when distributing your app as a Progressive Web App (PWA).

Plugin | Description | Supported in PWA
-------|-------------|---
[AppShield](<https://www.outsystems.com/forge/component-overview/9379//>) | Protect your mobile apps from tampering. OutSystems AppShield hardens the native mobile build, enabling the app to detect attempts of modification and misuse. | —
[Card IO](<https://www.outsystems.com/forge/component/1438/card-io-plugin/>) | Automatically get the details of a credit card by taking a picture. | —
[Camera](<https://www.outsystems.com/forge/component-overview/1390/camera-plugin>) | Enable your application to access the camera capabilities of the device. | Yes
[Calendar](<https://www.outsystems.com/forge/component/1566/calendar-plugin/>) | Access the calendar of your device. | —
[Contacts](<https://www.outsystems.com/forge/component-overview/1394/contacts-plugin>) | Access the contacts of your device. | —
[Ciphered Local Storage](<https://www.outsystems.com/forge/component-details/1500/ciphered-local-storage-plugin/>) | Keep your mobile application's sensitive data safe using a ciphered local storage database. | —
[File](<https://www.outsystems.com/forge/component-overview/1633/file-plugin>) | Lets you manage files and folders on a mobile device within the app sandbox. | —
[File Transfer](<https://www.outsystems.com/forge/component-overview/1409/file-transfer-plugin>) | Lets you upload and download files in the background in your native application. | —
[InApp Browser](<https://www.outsystems.com/forge/component/1558/inappbrowser-plugin/>) | Open external URLs directly in your application. | —
[OneSignal Notifications](<http://www.outsystems.com/forge/component/2119/onesignal-plugin/>) | Push notifications using OneSignal, with deep-linking and actions. | —
[Touch ID](<https://www.outsystems.com/forge/component-details/1431/Touch+ID+Plugin/>) | Use authentication with Touch ID in your application. | —
[QR/Barcode scanner](<https://www.outsystems.com/forge/component/1403/barcode-plugin/>) | Scan barcodes and QR codes. | —
[SSL Pinning](<https://www.outsystems.com/forge/component-overview/1873/ssl-pinning-plugin>) | Provide an extra layer of security to HTTPS communications by adding a verification of the server certificate against hashes of public keys. | —
[Key Store](<https://www.outsystems.com/forge/component/1550/Key+Store+Plugin/>) | Store small amounts of sensitive information on your device. Key Store secures data by encrypting the data before storing it, and the platform itself carefully controls access to stored items. | —
[Local Notifications](<http://www.outsystems.com/forge/component/1541/local-notifications-plugin/>) | Send app notifications to the device when the application isn't running in the foreground. | —
[Location](<https://www.outsystems.com/forge/component/1395/location-plugin/>) | Access the GPS capabilities of the user's device to show, for example, the present latitude, longitude, and  altitude. | Yes

Once you [install the plugin](<../../getting-started/component.md>) in the environment it functions just like any other native OutSystems component: use the client actions of the plugin module to call the native capabilities of the device within your application. Make sure that the plugin supports the mobile platforms (iOS, Android) for which you are creating an app. If it is not supported app generation will fail.

Each time you add, remove, or modify the plugin in an app, OutSystems [rebuilds the native shell](<../../deliver-mobile/mobile-app-update-scenarios.md#Situations_When_the_User_Must_Install_a_New_Build>) which you then have to distribute to the end users for installation.

You must [include the plugin license](<../../deliver-mobile/compliance-with-third-party-licenses.md#Include_the_Third_Party_Licenses_Used_by_Plug-ins_or_Components>) in your app to respect the license agreements of that plugin. These license agreements are usually placed in the About page of the app that uses them.

## Additional mobile plugin resources

The Forge also contains mobile plugins created and supported by the OutSystems community, which you can freely use as is, make modifications as required, or as an accelerator to build your own.

You may also create mobile plugins by [wrapping an Apache Cordova plugin into a module](<using-cordova-plugins.md>).
