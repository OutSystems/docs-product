Use the LifeTime SDK to develop your own plug-ins for LifeTime, thus extending LifeTime functionality. The LifeTimeSDK contains the base layout components and APIs used to develop a LifeTime plug-in.

To start developing your LifeTime plug-in, you need to do the following:

1. Install the LifeTime SDK on a development environment.
1. Export LifeTime data to the environment where you will be developing the plug-in.
1. Develop the plug-in using the development environment: once the LifeTimeSDK is installed on an environment, a new button is made available, to create an application with the necessary references for the LifeTimeSDK.
1. Deploy the new plug-in to the environment running LifeTime. 

To learn more on how to develop your LifeTime plug-in, access the `http://<LifeTime_environment>/LifeTimeSDK` screen on your infrastructure.
