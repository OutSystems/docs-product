The preparation stage is a period of refactoring and adjusting your O11 apps so that they're ready for a smooth migration to the ODC platform.

## Prerequisites

Before you refactor your O11 apps to be ODC-compatible, ensure you have:

* [Designed your future ODC architecture](../plan/plan-map-apps.md#design-arch)
* [Mapped your O11 apps to ODC assets](../plan/plan-map-apps.md#map-in-tool)
* [Identified and adjusted any inconsistencies in the mapping of your O11 apps to ODC architecture](../plan/plan-assess-refactor.md#adjust-mapping)

## Prepare O11 app migration

Hereâ€™s the high-level process on how you can prepare your O11 app to be ODC-compatible:

1. [Adjust O11 apps to make them compatible with ODC](prep-refactor-o11-apps.md)

1. Deploy O11 apps to QA

1. Test O11 apps

## Additional resources

Here's some additional resources and training materials that can help you understand ODC architecture better:
