# Designing Screens

This page contains an overview of widgets. It also links to pages that provide additional information about widgets available to help you design Screens.

## Widgets overview
Widgets in OutSystems are visual elements that help you to design and organize your appâ€™s user interface. They serve as building blocks to accelerate UI development. 

You can drag widgets to UI Screens, and then set their relevant properties. Widgets appear in the Service Studio toolbox, on the left side of the main screen. Available widgets vary by app type. 

You can use widgets to accelerate the following development tasks, among many others:

* Display one or more record or line of information with display widgets, such as **Table** widgets
* Take input from users with widgets such as **Text** and **Input** widgets
* Use **Button** or **Link** widgets to navigate between Screens or to trigger other actions
* Display one of two areas on a Screen based on a Boolean condition with an **If Widget**
* Provide yes or no input options or one selection out of many options with 
**Checkbox** or **Radio Button** widgets 
* Use **Container** widgets to group other widgets and to apply styles to them 
* Create reusable UI elements for use within an app or across apps with **Block** or **Web Block** widgets
