# Use Icons

Icons are small pictograms or symbols to help end users identify functionality or information on screens. OutSystems provides more than 600 Icons on a built-in collection of icons that can be used on the interface of applications.

You can use Icons together with other patterns. For example, you can add an Icon as a button label. 

Also, you can add actions to your icons, for example, you can add an Folder icon and associate an Onclick action, that with the right client action enables your users to navigate in your file system and select a file.
