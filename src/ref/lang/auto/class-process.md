# Process

A process is an element that allows you to integrate your business processes into your applications. It's designed in a process flow, which usually represents the activities that have to be carried out during an entity life cycle. 

Check how to [use processes](<../../processes/intro.md>) in OutSystems.

## Exposed Process Activity

A Process Activity **cannot be exposed** if their Process is not exposed or the module is Multi-tenant. 

Process activities that can be exposed are:

* Human Activity
* Wait
* Conditional Start
