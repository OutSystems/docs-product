# Managing access to cases

Managing access permissions helps you ensure the protection of case data. **Access control** is built into the **Case Management framework** and allows you to manage who in your organization has access to case data.

When you define what case types a user can view and edit, you ensure only the appropriate users are able to access specific areas of your business processes.

Let’s take an example of an app created for a banking institution where two different groups of users work: the debt control management group and the investment research group. All employees require access to the app, but only the debt control group should have access to the debt related cases, due to privacy reasons. We can enable access control to grant access to the debt control group, so those users are the only ones with read and write permissions for those types of cases. So, access control allows you to restrict access to each type of case depending on each user’s credentials.

When [Access Control is enabled](how-enable-ac.md), restriction to the cases is the default setting and users can only gain access by being granted permission to do so.

You can select between a single user, or all users that belong to a particular group. Permissions granted can either be read-only or write. Write enables a user to perform changes to the case.
