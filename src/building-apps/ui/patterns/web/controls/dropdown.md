# Dropdown

You can use the Dropdown UI Pattern to allow users make a choice from several options. Use the Dropdown UI Pattern to offer a choice of more than **four** options. The Dropdown UI Pattern is used when you want to display rich content, such as images. For a very large number of options, consider using the Dropdown Select UI Pattern to avoid loss of context.

**How to use the Dropdown UI Pattern**

In this example, we create a dropdown containing a list of employee names from an existing database. Once an employee is selected from the dropdown, a feedback message is displayed.

1. In Service Studio, in the Toolbox, search for `Dropdown`.

    The Dropdown widget is displayed.

    ![Service Studio interface showing the Dropdown widget in the Toolbox](images/dropdown-1-ss.png "Service Studio Dropdown Widget")

    If the UI widget doesn't display, it's because the dependency isn't added. This happens because the Remove unused references setting is enabled. To make the widget available in your app:

    1. In the Toolbox, click **Search in other modules**.

    1. In **Search in other Modules**, remove any spaces between words in your search text.
    
    1. Select the widget you want to add from the **OutSystemsUIWeb** module, and click **Add Dependency**. 
    
    1. In the Toolbox, search for the widget again.

1. From the Toolbox, drag the Dropdown widget into the Main Content area of your application's screen.

    ![Dragging the Dropdown widget into the Main Content area of an application screen in Service Studio](images/dropdown-2-ss.png "Drag Dropdown Widget to Main Content")

1. On the **Properties** tab, enter a name for the Dropdown widget.

    In this example, we enter `EmployeeDropdown`.

    ![Properties tab in Service Studio with the name 'EmployeeDropdown' entered for the Dropdown widget](images/dropdown-5-ss.png "Naming the Dropdown Widget")

1. Right-click your screen name, and select **Add Preparation**.  

    ![Context menu in Service Studio with the option to add Preparation to a screen](images/dropdown-6-ss.png "Adding Preparation to Screen")

1. From the Toolbox, drag an Aggregate onto the Preparation.

    ![Dragging an Aggregate onto the Preparation in Service Studio](images/dropdown-7-ss.png "Adding an Aggregate to Preparation")

1. To add a database entity, double-click the Aggregate. Click the screen, and from the **Select Source** popup, select the database you want to use (in this example, the **Employee** database). Click **OK**.

    ![Select Source popup in Service Studio for choosing the Employee database entity for an Aggregate](images/dropdown-8-ss.png "Selecting Database Entity for Aggregate")

1. Return to your screen by double-clicking your screen name. From the Toolbox, drag the List Records widget into the **DropdownList** placeholder, and on the **Properties** tab, from the **Source Record List** dropdown, select the relevant record list.

    In this example, we select the **GetEmployees.List**.

    ![List Records widget in Service Studio with the Source Record List property set to 'GetEmployees.List'](images/dropdown-9-ss.png "Configuring List Records Widget")

1. From the Toolbox, drag an Expression widget into the List Records widget, and on the **Properties** tab, set the **Value** property to the values you want to display in the dropdown.

    In this example, we set it to the employee names.

    ![Expression widget in Service Studio set to display employee names in the Dropdown](images/dropdown-10-ss.png "Setting Values in Dropdown")

1. To make each of the values in the dropdown selectable, right-click the expression, and select **Link to** -> **New Screen Action**.

    ![Context menu in Service Studio to link an expression to a new Screen Action](images/dropdown-11-ss.png "Linking Expression to Screen Action")

1. On the **Properties** tab, set the **Method** property to **Ajax Submit**.

    ![Properties tab in Service Studio with the Method property set to Ajax Submit for a screen action](images/dropdown-14-ss.png "Setting Ajax Submit Method")

1. Double-click the new screen action, and enter a name in the **Name** property.

    In this example, we call it SelectedUser.

    ![Service Studio screen action properties with the name 'SelectedUser' entered](images/dropdown-20-ss.png "Naming New Screen Action")

1. Double-click the new screen action, and from the Toolbox, drag the **Run Server Action** onto the screen action. In the **Select Action** popup, search for and select the **Feedback_Message** and click **OK**.

    ![Dragging Run Server Action onto a screen action in Service Studio](images/dropdown-12-ss.png "Adding Run Server Action")

1. Set the message text and type.

    In this example, we set the message type to **Info** and set the message text to display the currently selected employee.

    ![Service Studio properties tab with the message type set to Info and the message text displaying the selected employee](images/dropdown-13-ss.png "Setting Feedback Message")

1. Return to your screen by double-clicking the screen name. Right-click your screen name and select **Add Local Variable**. Enter a name and a default value for the variable.

    ![Context menu in Service Studio for adding a local variable to a screen](images/dropdown-22-ss.png "Adding Local Variable to Screen")

1. Drag the variable into the dropdown **Prompt** placeholder and enter a name and a value.  

    ![Dragging a local variable into the Prompt placeholder of the Dropdown in Service Studio](images/dropdown-21-ss.png "Configuring Dropdown Prompt Placeholder")

1. Double-click your screen action, add an **Assign**, and set the variable value. In this example, we set the variable to the currently selected employee.

    ![Assign widget in Service Studio screen action to set the value of a variable to the selected employee](images/dropdown-3-ss.png "Setting Variable Value in Screen Action")

1. Add an **Ajax Refresh** to the screen action and in the **Select Widget** popup, select the widget you want to refresh.

    In this example, we select the expression that holds the currently selected employee.

    ![Ajax Refresh widget in Service Studio screen action to refresh the expression displaying the selected employee](images/dropdown-4-ss.png "Adding Ajax Refresh to Screen Action")

1. Select the **Logic** tab, navigate to **Interaction** -> **ToggleElement** and drag it onto the screen action. This closes the dropdown once a value is selected.

    ![Dragging ToggleElement onto a screen action in Service Studio to close the Dropdown after selection](images/dropdown-15-ss.png "Closing Dropdown with ToggleElement")

After following these steps and publishing the module, you can test the pattern in your app.
