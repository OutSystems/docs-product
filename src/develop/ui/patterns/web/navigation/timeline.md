You can use the Timeline UI Pattern to show related events in a chronological order, such as a user’s upcoming, current, and past activities.

**How to use the Timeline UI Pattern**


1. In Service Studio, in the Toolbox, search for `Timeline`. 

    The Timeline widget is displayed.

1. From the Toolbox, drag the Timeline widget onto your application’s screen.

    ![](images/timeline-image-2.png?width=500)


1. Set the required content in the Icon, Date, and Content placeholders. 

    By default, the Icon placeholder displays a circular icon. To change it, drag an icon widget to this placeholder.
