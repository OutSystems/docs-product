# Entities Change Management

If the table definition changes or is not consistent with the entity definition, you have to update the entity definition.  

To update the entity definition do one of the following operations:

* **Refresh** the entity definition in Integration Studio. To refresh this definition, you can [refresh](<entity-refresh.md>) that entity only or run the [Import Entity from Database](<entity-import-from-database.md>) wizard again. In both situations, the new entity definition is imported to your extension and all the changes you have made directly in Integration Studio will be lost, except the entity name.

* **Manage** the entity definition directly in Integration Studio. The [Entity editor](<../../../ref/integration-studio/editor/entity.md>) allows you to change the properties and attributes of the entity.
