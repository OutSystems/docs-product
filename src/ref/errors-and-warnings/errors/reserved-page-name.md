# Reserved Page Name

Service Studio shows the **Reserved Page Name**:

* The Page Name in [name_of_screen] screen contains a string that is not supported: "[reserved_string]". Use a different Page Name.

The error shows when you try using a reserved string as part of the URL. Fix the error by removing the reserved string. You can find the list of strings in [Managing custom Screen URLs](../../../develop/seo/intro.md#managing-custom-screen-urls).
