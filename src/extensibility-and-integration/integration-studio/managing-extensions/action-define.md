# Define Extension Actions

Once you have created your extension you may define the actions exported by it. These actions allow you to use its functionality in a different application or technology.

To add an action to your extension, execute one of the following operations:

* [Add the action](<action-add.md>) manually to the extension.

* Import the action from a .NET assembly, through the [Import Actions from .NET Assembly](<net-assembly-import-action.md>) wizard.
