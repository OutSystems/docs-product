# Margin Container

You can use the Margin Container UI Pattern to add symmetrical padding around a container.

**How to use the Margin Container UI Pattern**

1. In Service Studio, in the Toolbox, search for `Margin Container`.

    The Margin Container widget is displayed.

    ![](<images/margincontainer-2-ss.png>)

    If the UI widget doesn't display, it's because the dependency isn't added. For example, if you are using a ready-made app, it deletes unused widgets from the module. To make the widget available in your app:

    1. In the Toolbox, click **Search in other modules**.

    1. In **Search in other Modules**, remove any spaces between words in your search text.
    
    1. Select the widget you want to add from the **OutSystemsUI** module, and click **Add Dependency**. 
    
    1. In the Toolbox, search for the widget again.

1. From the Toolbox, drag the Margin Container widget into the Main Content area of your application's screen.

    ![](<images/margincontainer-3-ss.png>)

    You can add as many Margin Container widgets as you want. In this example, we add 2.

1. Add the relevant content to the Margin Container placeholder.

    In this example we add an image widget to each of the placeholders and on the **Properties** tab, import an image using the **Image** dropdown.

    ![](<images/margincontainer-4-ss.png>)

After following these steps and publishing the module, you can test the pattern in your app.
