# Upgrade OutSystems cache invalidation with high-availability

This guide shows how to upgrade your [previously created RabbitMQ cluster](high-availability.md).

There are two strategies for upgrading a simple RabbitMQ cluster. They're described with the pros and cons of each. The first is the more recommended approach:

* Cluster Full-Stop

    * Pros

        * The process is more secure
        * The process updates the data in queues

    * Cons

        * The process has downtime

* Rolling Upgrade

    * Pros

        * No downtime is necessary

    * Cons

        * If your current RabbitMQ version is older than 3.7.18, youâ€™ll need to proceed with an intermediary upgrade to version 3.7.18 and then to 3.8.3. Version 3.7.18 and later 3.7.x versions support rolling upgrades with feature flags allowing mixed-version clusters
        * The process includes an Erlang upgrade, which recreates the queues

Ensure the new Erlang version is compatible with the RabbitMQ version being installed. See [here](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html) for details.
The RabbitMQ version needs to fulfill your OutSystems [system requirements](../system-requirements.md).

During upgrades, it's helpful to do a HealthCheck at various moments. The management UI enables this. A [management plugin](https://www.rabbitmq.com/management.html) installation is required. A HealthCheck is done at http://localhost:15672 (15672 is the default port, you may have configured it differently). Alternatively, go to the `sbin` folder under the RabbitMQ installation directory and use the command `rabbitmqctl cluster_status`.

## Cluster Full-Stop upgrade strategy

In this example, a simple RabbitMQ cluster with two nodes running on separate servers, "ServerA" and "ServerB", is upgraded. This strategy requires a cluster full-stop, and so downtime is expected. The order of server upgrades is important. Proceed with the following approach:

* Do a health check

* Stop the nodes

    * For each server, open a command line with administrator privileges, change the working directory to the `sbin` folder and run the following command: `rabbitmqctl stop_app` (there is a possibility that you have to specify the node, add `--node rabbit` at the end of the previous command)

* Upgrade the first node

    * Uninstall the old version of Erlang
    * Install the new version of Erlang
    * Install the new RabbitMQ version

* Upgrade the second node

    * Uninstall the old version of Erlang
    * Install the new version of Erlang
    * Install the new RabbitMQ version

* Start the first node

    * `rabbitmqctl start_app`

* Start the second node

    * `rabbitmqctl start_app`

* Perform a health check

## Rolling upgrade strategy

Rolling upgrades between some versions are unsupported. Version 3.7.18 and later 3.7.x versions support rolling upgrades to 3.8.x using feature flags. For more information about upgrade version jumps, without downtime, check [here](https://www.rabbitmq.com/upgrade.html).

We highly recommend that you do a full-stop upgrade if coming from versions earlier than 3.7.18 and intend to do a major upgrade. Check if your upgrade is supported [here](https://www.rabbitmq.com/upgrade.html#rolling-upgrades).

In this example, a simple RabbitMQ cluster with two nodes running on separate servers, "ServerA" and "ServerB", is upgraded.

* Do a health check
* Stop the first node

    * Go to the `sbin` folder and execute `rabbitmqctl` stop_app

* Upgrade the first node

    * Uninstall the old version of Erlang
    * Install the new version of Erlang
    * Install the new RabbitMQ version

* Start the first node

    * Go to the `sbin` folder and execute `rabbitmqctl start_app`

* Do a health check

* Stop the second node

    * Go to the `sbin` folder and execute: `rabbitmqctl stop_app`

* Upgrade the second node

    * Uninstall the old version of Erlang
    * Install the new version of Erlang
    * Install the new RabbitMQ version

* Start the second  node

    * Go to the `sbin` folder and execute `rabbitmqctl start_app`

* Do a health check
