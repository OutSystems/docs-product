# Create and Use a Popup

You can use a popup to provide information to the end users or ask for their input. This results in a better experience for end users because they are kept in context while entering the input.

## In Reactive Web and Mobile

To create and use a popup in Reactive Web and Mobile apps:

1. Drag the Popup widget to the screen. 

1. Add a variable of Boolean type to the screen to control the popup visibility (you can use it to show or hide the popup). 

1. Set the Show Popup property with the variable. This will effectively toggle the popup according to the variable value. 

1. Implement a Client Action in the screen to display the popup by assigning `True` to the variable. 

1. Implement the popup content.
