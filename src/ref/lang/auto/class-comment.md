# Comment

Comment is a tool that lets you add a text box with code comments for developers. Comments are handy when you need to add remarks or reminders for yourself or team members.

If you write **TODO**, **TBD**, or **REMINDER** in uppercase, the comment shows in the TrueChange&#8482; tab. You can also set **Is Reminder** of any comment to **Yes** to make it visible in the tab. 

You can add links in comments by using the `a` HTML tag. For example: `This a <a href="https:\\www.example.com">link to a website</a>.`
