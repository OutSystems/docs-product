# File Menu

The File menu contains the following operations:

Menu Item | Description

![](images/file-open.gif) Open | Opens an extension already created in Integration Studio. Simply select the XIF (Extension and Integration Framework) file and all the elements defined for the extension are available in the [Extension](<../../multi-tree-navigator.md>) and [Resources](<../../resources-tree.md>) tree.
Close | Closes the current extension. If you have not saved it, Integration Studio prompts you with the Save window.
