# Table Records Widget


You can use the Table Records widget to display the records of an entity or a structure in a tabular layout. You can define the table records as sortable making it easier for the user to read or find information faster. Record sorting can be fixed or dynamic, meaning that it can change during runtime. You can change the emphasis of a table row by changing its height and increase users' ability to read and interpret data in a table record by using zebra stripping. You can also use pagination to divide content and present it in a limited and digestible manner.

## How to use the Table Records widget

In this example, user data is fetched from the User entity and displayed on screen using the Table Records widget.

1. In Service Studio, in the Toolbox, search for `Table Records`.

    The Table Records widget is displayed.

    ![Table Records widget](<images/tablerecords-2-ss.png>)

1. From the Toolbox, drag the Table Records widget into the Main Content area of your application's screen.

    ![Drag Table Records widget onto screen](<images/tablerecords-3-ss.png>)

1. Add the relevant content to the Table Records widget. 

    In this example, from the **Data** tab, we drag the **User** entity into the Table Records widget. 

    ![Drag User database into widget](<images/tablerecords-4-ss.png>)

1. Return to your screen by selecting the **Interface** tab. Right-click the screen name and select **Add Preparation**.

    ![Add preparation](<images/tablerecords-5-ss.png>)

1. Add an Aggregate to the Preparation.

    ![Add an aggregate](<images/tablerecords-7-ss.png>)

1. Double-click the Aggregate, click the screen, and from the **Select Source** popup, select the database entity you want to retrieve data from. Click **OK**. In this example, we select the User entity.

    ![Select source entity](<images/tablerecords-6-ss.png>)

    The **GetUsers** aggregate is created.

    ![GetUsers aggregate is created](<images/tablerecords-8-ss.png>)

1. Return to your main screen, select the Table Records widget, and on the **Properties** tab, select the Source Record List (in this example, the GetUsers aggregate we just created).

After following these steps and publishing the module, you can test the widget in your app.

### How to add a new column

1. Select and right-click the Table Records widget, and select **Table** > **Insert Column to the Left** or **Insert column to the Right**.

## Layout of the widget

The layout of this widget follows these rules:

* Each record of the entity or structure corresponds to one row in this widget.
* Each attribute corresponds to one column.
* For each attribute, there is one column with **n+1** rows with the following semantics:

    **First row:** The name of the attribute that corresponds to the **Label** property, if any, or the name of the attribute. You can apply styles to this row, by setting the **Header style** property.

    **Other rows:** The value of the attribute for each record shows as a Expression widget and, therefore, you can use the Expression editor to modify the content. You can also use the input widgets to allow editing. Set different styles in odd and even lines with **Odd Line style** and **Even Line style** properties.


## Iterating the widget

Set the source data (entity and/or structure records) in the **Source Record List** property of Table Records. The data must be of the List type, and each item of the list shows on a different line. The first record that shows in the widget corresponds to the **Start Index** position on the list. The number of records that the table shows depends on the **Line Count** property.

To iterate over the Source Record List, you have to update the **Start Index** property for each iteration by using the **Line Count** and **Start Index** runtime properties of the Table Records widget.

## Additional notes

* The widget **Id** runtime property is only available in the screen scope when the widget property **Name** isn't empty.
* **LineCount** and **StartIndex** are useful when you want to implement the previous/next behavior of a Table Records widget, because the parameters control how many records you show in the table and from which record number. Scaffold a screen by dragging an Entity to a web flow to get a table with pagination. You can then check out how **LineCount** and **StartIndex** work. 
* If you have an Aggregate in the Preparation that provides a list of records to Table Records and you leave empty the value **Max. Records** of the Aggregate, the platform calculates the value of **Max. Records** for you according to the following formula: **Start Index** of the Table Records + **Line Count** of the table + 1. A workaround is to set a static **Line Count** in the Table Records widget that's at least equal to the maximum number of records your query can retrieve.
