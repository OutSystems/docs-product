# Aggregate

Fetch data using an optimized query. Aggregates can load data from the server of the local database, and they support combining several Entities and advanced filtering.

## Client-side Aggregates

Client-side Aggregates run in the client logic. Use them to get data for your widgets when a Screen or a Block loads. Follow the steps: 

1. Right-click a Screen or a Block and select **Fetch data from Database**. An empty Aggregate opens, and Service Studio shows that you need to add an Entity.

1. With the Aggregate still open, navigate to **Data** > **Entities** > **Database**.

1. Drag one of the Entities to the Aggregate window. Service Studio populates the Aggregate with columns that correspond to the attributes of the Entity. Note also the name change; if your Entity is **MyEntity**, the Aggregate gets the name **GetMyEntity**.

1. Go back to your Screen or Block and set an element to use the data. For example, if you have a **List** widget, set the **Source** of the List widget to **GetMyEntity.List**. You can always double-click an Aggregate to add more Entities, join data, or create filters.

## Server-side Aggregates

Aggregates that run in the **server-side logic** are in the logic flows. To add an Aggregate in the server logic, drag an Aggregate from the toolbox to the flow of an action.

## Fetching all records in client-side logic

There are cases when you always need to fetch all records from the database, for example to populate drop-down box lists. There are two ways of doing it:

* Use a Screen Aggregate and set **Max. Records** higher than the maximum number of records you expect. Keep in mind that large amounts of data may slow down the user interface and degrade the responsiveness of the app.
* Use a Data Action instead of Screen Aggregate and leave **Max. Records** field empty. In Data Actions, the **Max. Records** value is optional, and if you provide no value the Data Action fetches all records from the database.   

## Traditional Web Apps

In Traditional Web Apps, Aggregates run on the server, so you can only add [server-side Aggregates](#server-side-aggregates).

To load data when the screen loads in Traditional Web Apps, place an Aggregate in the **Preparation** action (right-click a screen add select **Add Preparation**.). **Preparation** exists in Traditional Web Apps only.
