# Refactor anonymous and registered roles 

You can use [roles](../../../user-management/user-roles/intro.md) to restrict or allow end users to access specific screens and operations of your application. O11 provides the [anonymous and registered](../../../user-management/user-roles/intro.md#system-roles-and-custom-roles) system roles.  

In ODC, you don't have the **anonymous** and **registered** system roles. Hence, you must remove these roles from screens and logic and replace them with app roles.
