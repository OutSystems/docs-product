This document is a work in progress and we invite you to share your feedback in the [forum topic dedicated to the PWA feature](https://www.outsystems.com/forums/discussion/56090/progressive-web-apps-early-access-now-open-to-everyone/).

# Early Access - Distribute as a progressive web app (PWA)

Progressive web apps (PWA) provide native-like experiences without having to distribute a native app. When you develop PWAs in OutSystems, you get all the benefits of the low-code development, as all you need is to build a Mobile App and enable the PWA feature.

<div class="info" markdown="1">

## Prerequisites

To distribute your app as a PWA, you need to meet the following requirements:

* Service Studio 11.6.21.8208 or later
* Platform Server 11.7.0.3110 or later
* LifeTime Oct.2019 CP1 or later
* Enabled the [early access feature](https://success.outsystems.com/Support/Enterprise_Customers/Upgrading/Early_access_to_OutSystems_features) in LifeTime
* Application Server requires a valid SSL certificate to allow HTTPS communication 

</div>

## Create a Progressive Web App

<div class="info" markdown="1">

The **Distribute** tab is available only after you activate the feature in LifeTime.

</div>

Create a Mobile App and turn on the toggle **Distribute as PWA** in the app details. 

1. Start creating a new app, and in the **New Application** window select **Phone App** or **Tablet App** app template. Note that the PWA feature works with Mobile Apps only.
2. Add a Screen and some logic to it.
3. Publish the app.
4. In the app details, under the **Distribute** tab, turn on the toggle **Distribute as PWA**. To locate the **Distribute** tab, go back to the home screen of Service Studio and click your application icon.

You don't have to republish your app after changing the value of the **Distribute as PWA**. This change is applied in real-time.

If you stage your app to another environment during the early access, for example to a production server, you need to connect to the environment with Service Studio and activate the PWA for that environment.

## Try out your progressive web app

Here is how you can run your PWA. Go to app details and click **Distribute** tab:

* To open on your mobile device, scan the QR code.
* To open in a desktop browser, click the link.

### PWA in Android

Follow these steps to install and run your PWA on an Android device.

1. Visit the app URL in Chrome.
2. Tap the banner **Add (my app) to Home screen**.

3. After you see a confirmation saying that the app was added to the home screen, open the app like any other app installed from a store. You can also uninstall it like any other app.

### PWA in iOS

Follow these steps to install and run your PWA on an iOS device.

<div class="info" markdown="1">

Due to a bug in iOS, the PWA is not working in the iOS versions 13.0 to 13.2. Use iOS 13.3 or later instead.

</div>

If you're running iOS 13 and later, running your PWA on iOS requires enabling the Web SQL settings. Go to **Settings** > **Safari** > **Advanced** > **Experimental Features** > and make sure **Disable Web SQL** is off.

Now you can visit the URL and install your app.

1. Visit the app URL in Safari.
2. Tap the Share button. The share menu opens.

3. Tap **Add to home screen**. The confirmation screen opens.

4. In the confirmation screen, tap **Add**.

5. Your app should now be on the home screen. You can also uninstall it like any other app.

## Customize your app

You can customize your app by:

* Editing the details in the app details screen
* Overriding the settings in by using the [PWA manifest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest) in the Extensibility Configuration

### Changing the app properties

You can edit your app name, description, color, and logo through the UI of Service Studio. Make sure you republish the app.
  
### The manifest values editable in Service Studio

The manifest is generated automatically, and you don't have to use it unless you want to override some values. You can edit the following manifest options from the Service Studio UI.

| Service Studio property | Manifest key  |
| ----------------------- | ------------- |
| Application Name        | `name`        |
| Application Description | `description` |
| App Primary Color       | `theme_color` |
| Application Logo*       | `icons`       |

(*) Service Studio generates the four required resolutions of the icon.

### Overriding the manifest settings {#override-pwa-manifest}

<div class="info" markdown="1">

Keep in mind that the LifeTime PWA manifest overrides the manifest in Service Studio.

</div>

Using the manifest overrides the values you set in Service Studio. You have to use the manifest in the `PWAManifest` section of the JSON of the **Extensibility Configurations** field. You can edit the manifest in two places:

* In Service Studio, where the manifest overrides any settings you have in UI **in all environments**. Edit the JSON manifest in **Extensibility Configurations** field of the module properties.
* In LifeTime, where the manifest overrides any settings you have in UI **in the current environment only**. You can find the **Extensibility Configurations** field in the **Applications** tab, under the **Advanced** section.

### Manifest resources and sample JSON

You can use [Web App Manifest Generator](https://app-manifest.firebaseapp.com/) to generate the manifest, or experiment with the sample we provide here.

```
{ 
   "PWAManifest":{ 
      "name":"Name overridden",
      "short_name":"ShortName overridden",
      "description":"Description overridden",
      "theme_color":"#EDEDED",
      "background_color":"black",
      "dir":"ltr",
      "orientation": "portrait",
      "serviceworker":{ 
         "src":"/PWAServiceWorker/scripts/PWAServiceWorker.ServiceWorker.js"
      }
   }
}
```

## Plugins in PWA {#plugins}

During the early access, you can try out the following officially supported plugins in your PWAs:

* [Camera Plugin](https://www.outsystems.com/forge/component-overview/1390/camera-plugin), from version 6.0
* [Location Plugin](https://www.outsystems.com/forge/component-versions/1395), from version 5.1

There are more plugins coming soon, and you can contribute with your own on the Forge.

## Debugging

The Debugger is currently not available for PWAs. We advise you to use the debugging capabilities of your browser to troubleshoot any runtime issues with your PWA.

## Troubleshooting

Here are some notes that can help you in troubleshooting the PWA feature.

### The toggle button has no effect

Note that you need to republish your apps after the Platform Server upgrade for the new features to work correctly, as instructed in the Platform Server upgrade list. If you haven't done it already, republish the apps in the factory and then turn on the toggle **Distribute as PWA**.

There is a potential workaround for the PWA toggle button to work without the republishing step, which is to republish the current module once and then try turning on the toggle **Distribute as PWA**. However, keep in mind that republishing the apps after the upgrade is a mandatory step, and skipping it can cause unintended effects.
