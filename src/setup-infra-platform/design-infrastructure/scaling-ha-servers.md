# Scaling and high availability for OutSystems Platform servers

<div class="info" markdown="1">

**Important:** The information in this guide applies only to OutSystems Platform on-premises or private cloud deployments.

</div>

OutSystems is ready for you to design your infrastructure for high availability.

Servers can be scaled for clustering, failover and performance. Databases should implement the recommended vendor policies.

## Server roles

The characteristics of each [OutSystems Platform server role](server-roles.md) define how they can be clustered and how failover is implemented.

| **Role**                  | **Cluster Capable** | **Failover** |
|---------------------------|---------------------|--------------|
| **Front-end**             | Yes                 | Yes          |
| **Deployment Controller** | No                  | Yes*         |
| **Scheduler**             | Yes                 | Yes          |
| **LifeTime Front-end**    | Yes                 | Yes          |

### Front-end

In a cluster scenario, the **Front-end** role scales best horizontally. Balancing the load across nodes will provide failover and several levels of disaster recovery, depending on the implementation.

The design can range from a segmented distribution of **Front-ends** that contain small incidents, to a geographical distribution aimed at containing high-risk events.

To properly scale your **Front-end** horizontally, OutSystems recommends that you decide on a suitable set of hardware specs for the **Front-end** server, and replicate that configuration on subsequent **Front-end** machines.

### Deployment controller

This service can only grow vertically since it has no cluster capability. Adding CPU cores, memory and increasing disk I/O will provide faster compile times for large/very active teams.

In a Production environment, it's only in use when new application versions are published. In a Development environment, it's used every time a developer publishes an module, application, or solution.

### Scheduler

This role can be activated in any node with the **Front-end** or **Deployment Controller** roles. The OutSystems platform will distribute the load generated by [timer executions](https://success.outsystems.com/documentation/11/developing_an_application/use_timers/) across all nodes that have this role, within the same OutSystems zone.

![Diagram showing horizontal scaling with three servers: a front-end with scheduler, a deployment controller with scheduler, and a dedicated scheduler.](images/scaling-ha-servers_2.png "Horizontal Scaling with Scheduler Role")

With heavy analytics timers, the pressure on shared **Front-end** and **Deployment Controller** nodes can negatively influence their performance. In this case, a dedicated **Scheduler** node or nodes are recommended.

### LifeTime

LifeTime scales horizontally like any **Front-end,** mostly for high availability reasons, since it simply consists of a very light management console.

You should set up a dedicated node with, at least, the [recommended hardware requirements](sizing-platform.md) for a **Front-end** role.

## Database

Within the databases that the OutSystems supports, there are several high availability options. Check the following vendor documentation for specific extra details.

* [SQL Server](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/ms190202.aspx)

* [Oracle](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/high-availability.html)

Check the [Infrastructure Design Examples](infra-design-examples.md) for some simple scenarios where database high availability is represented.

## Cache invalidation with high-availability

RabbitMQ can be configured to work as a cluster, offering benefits like fault-tolerance, high availability and data replication. If your [application requires that the cache invalidation service is always available](https://success.outsystems.com/documentation/11/setup_and_maintain_your_outsystems_infrastructure/setting_up_outsystems/cache_invalidation_in_outsystems_11/#when-ha), [you should use a RabbitMQ cluster](https://success.outsystems.com/documentation/11/setup_and_maintain_your_outsystems_infrastructure/setting_up_outsystems/possible_setups_for_an_outsystems_infrastructure/high_availability_and_scalability_strategies/).
