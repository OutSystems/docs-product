# Getting Started

OutSystems consists of several tools and cloud solutions, for developers, administrators, and operators. This document is intended for developers who are just starting to use Service Studio, the OutSystems IDE, and are building their first mobile and web apps.

## Create an account and install Development Environment

If you haven't signed in yet, start by creating a [free account](https://www.outsystems.com/home/GetStartedForFree.aspx) in our cloud. Then, download and install [the latest version of the Development Environment](https://www.outsystems.com/home/downloads). Once the installation is complete, you can start developing right away!

The Development Environment consists of two applications. The first is [Service Studio](service-studio.md), the main IDE. You will use it to develop apps for web, Android, and iOS. There's also Integration Studio, an IDE for writing extensions.

## Community

The OutSystems community welcomes all. We invite you to join the community in the [Forums](https://www.outsystems.com/forums/), be a part of the discussions about the platform and ask the community for help and advice. We are very interested in your suggestions about the IDE, the platform, and the documentation - so we encourage you to send [suggestions and Ideas](https://www.outsystems.com/ideas/).

## Training

We provide free [online courses](https://www.outsystems.com/learn/courses/) that teach how to use OutSystems technologies. There are official workshops as well. You may decide to pursue a career in OutSystems low-code development, there is a certification program to help you achieve that.

## Your first app

You have several quick tracks to create your first app with Service Studio:

Built-in tutorial
:   The quickest track to creating apps in OutSystems is through the interactive built-in tutorial. In Service Studio, open the Help menu and select **Build a App in 5 Minutes**. 

Documentation tutorials
:   You can also check the brief tutorials about creating a [mobile app](create-mobile.md) and a [reactive web app](create-reactive-web.md).

Start from an existing sample app
:   You can leverage a collection of existing apps in Service Studio to get you started. The experience includes a guided tour, which walks you through Service Studio and helps you customize and edit your new app. If you don't want to customize the app, you can also publish it and test right away. In Service Studio, create a new app and choose **Start from an app**.

## Creating and deploying apps

You build your apps in Service Studio, using OutSystems domain-specific visual language. There are several [application types](right-app.md) you can create, and the most common are mobile apps and web applications. The look and feel of the apps, which you can edit, is defined by [OutSystems UI](https://www.outsystems.com/outsystems-ui/). For example, use [Styles Editor](../develop/ui/look-feel/styles-editor.md) to change color, font, spacing or alignment. You can [edit CSS](../develop/ui/look-feel/css.md) as well.

While you are developing your apps, you can also [debug](../develop/troubleshoot/debug/intro.md) them. Use the 1-Click Publish button to publish your web or mobile application. You can [also work in teams](../develop/merge/concepts.md) to create your apps. If you are creating a mobile app, you can generate a [native build for Android and iOS](../deliver-mobile/generate-and-distribute-your-mobile-app/intro.md) - all within Service Studio.

In more [advanced development setups](../managing-the-applications-lifecycle/intro.md), usually with enterprise customers, dozens of apps are managed and developed on a development server, then moved to quality assurance servers, and finally deployed to one or more front-end servers or app stores.

## Hardware support

Service Studio IDE runs on any computer that satisfies [system requirements](https://success.outsystems.com/Support/Enterprise_Customers/Installation/OutSystems_Platform_system_requirements#Development_tools). The mobile apps you create in OutSystems can run on a range of iOS and Android devices. Your end users can open web applications in any modern browser.

## Extensions and plug-ins

With Development Environment you also get [Integration Studio](../ref/integration-studio/workspace.md). Use it to [write extensions](../extensibility-and-integration/integration-studio/getting-started/intro.md) for your apps. For example, extend the functionality of the application logic or [build custom database connections](../extensibility-and-integration/connect-external-db.md).

Our community has contributed many extensions which are available for download in [Forge](https://www.outsystems.com/forge/). For mobile apps, you can use some of the official [plug-ins](../extensibility-and-integration/mobile-plugins/intro.md) or [create plug-ins](../extensibility-and-integration/mobile-plugins/using-cordova-plugins.md) on your own.
