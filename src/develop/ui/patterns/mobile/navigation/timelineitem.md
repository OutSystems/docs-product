# Timeline Item

You can use the Timeline Item UI ?Item Pattern to show related events in a chronological order, such as a user’s upcoming, current, and past activities.

**How to use the Timeline Item UI Pattern**

1. In Service Studio, in the Toolbox, search for `Timeline Item`.

    The Timeline Item widget is displayed.

    ![](<images/timelineitem-2-ss.png>)

1. From the Toolbox, drag the Timeline widget onto your application’s screen.

    ![](<images/timelineitem-3-ss.png?width=800>)

    By default, the Timeline Item widget contains Left, Icon, Title, Content, and Right placeholders. You can add as many Timeline Item widgets as required. In this example we add two more Timeline Item widgets. 

1. Set the required content in each of the placeholders. 

    In this example we add some icons and text.

After following these steps and publishing the module, you can test the pattern in your app.
