# Stream logs to Elastic 

This article explains how you can set up log streaming from OutSystems applications to the **Elastic** APM tool. 

To set up the log streaming to Elastic, you need the **Elastic URL** and **Secret token** values. Once you have these, go to LifeTime and [configure the log streaming service](lifetime-streaming.md). 

## Prerequisites

* Enabled [Log separation](../../setup-infra-platform/setup/logging-db/logs-separation-cloud/intro.md).

* Native Elastic APM OpenTelemetry log ingestion is only available in version 8.0 onwards.

* The Elastic Observability services and Kibana plugins must be deployed alongside the Elasticsearch cluster to complete the following steps.

* Installed Platform Server version 11.23.1 or higher.

* Installed LifeTime version 11.19.0 or higher.
