# Unable to download the source code of an application

This article explains how you can troubleshoot if you are getting an error [downloading the source code package of an application](api-request-code.md).

## Step 1: Check if the user has Open and Debug over the application

To validate this requirement, follow these steps:

1. In the LifeTime management console, open the **User Management** tab and select the Service Accounts sub-menu.
1. Select the service account used on the source code access API by clicking the service account name.
1. Check if the level of permission of the user is Open and Debug on the environment you are requesting the source code.

The wrong permissions level returns a message: `You need permission to access the environment {EnvironmentKey} or the app {ApplicationKey}.`

## Step 2: Check if the environment key exists

Call the API method that returns all the environments registered on your infrastructure.
Request: `GET /lifetimeapi/rest/v2/environments/`

Response body:

```
[
  {...},
  {
    "Key": "849515f2-b4ff-4aca-a9d6-9407bea655f4",
    "Name": "Testing",
    "OSVersion": "11.0.110.0",
    "Order": 1,
    "HostName": "prd-env-1.company.com",
    "UseHTTPS": true,
    "EnvironmentType": "Production",
    "NumberOfFrontEnds": 1,
    "ApplicationServerType": ".NET",
    "ApplicationServer": "IIS",
    "DatabaseProvider": "SQLServer",
    "IsCloudEnvironment": false
  },
  {...}
]
```

Check that the environment key (**Key**) is correctly passed to the API call.

If the environment key does not exist, the API returns a message: `The environment {EnvironmentKey} or the app {ApplicationKey} doesn't exist.`

## Step 3: Check if the application key exists

Call the API that returns all the applications available on your infrastructure.

Request: `GET /lifetimeapi/rest/v2/applications/`

Response body:

```
[
  {...},
  {
    "Key": "c9a7a82e-0eee-4a3d-8e22-2a19c69c766f",
    "Name": "EmployeeBackoffice",
    "Kind": "WebResponsive",
    "Team": "",
    "Description": "",
    "URLPath": "/EmployeeBackoffice",
    "IconHash": "IconHash6a79e71e-c8e5-9e18-115c-cab789517672",
    "IconURL": "/LifeTimeSDK/ApplicationIcon.aspx?ApplicationKey=c9a7a82e-0eee-4a3d-8e22-2a19c69c766f",
    "IsSystem": false,
    "AppStatusInEnvs": []
  },
  {...}
]
```

Check that the application key (**Key**) is passed correctly to the API call.

If the application key does not exist, the API returns a message: `The environment {EnvironmentKey} or the app {ApplicationKey} doesn't exist.`

## Step 4: Check if the package is bigger than the size limit

If you see an Error message such as **The resulting source code package has X Mb. The maximum size allowed is 150 Mb. Please refer to documentation on how to overcome this error.**, this means that the resulting source code archive is bigger than 150Mb. In such scenarios, because of scalability and performance reasons the API cannot store and send such big files.

As a workaround, you can split the application to run the SAST in smaller apps and then call the API for these small applications.
