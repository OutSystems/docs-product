# Extending with ODC

You can extend your existing O11 portfolio with new [ODC cloud-native and AI-powered capabilities](https://www.outsystems.com/low-code-platform/developer-cloud/) by building new ODC apps that seamlessly consume your trusted resources from your existing O11 apps.

This interoperability approach enables you to maintain and evolve your core apps on O11 while using ODC to deliver new digital experiences, AI-powered agents, or high-performance portals.

## Interoperability use cases

Here are some scenarios where you can use ODC cloud-native capabilities to extend your O11 core apps:

* **New agentic use cases:** Apps that leverage the ODC Agent Workbench to classify tickets, summarize records, or provide conversational interfaces, grounded in trusted O11 data.

* **High-scale B2C apps:** Public-facing apps with unpredictable usage peaks that require the auto-scaling capabilities of ODC (for example, a Black Friday campaign app).

* **Apps with low O11 dependencies:** New use cases, such as a field-service mobile app, that are mostly self-contained but require specific master data (like customer lists) from O11.

* **Extension portals:** New portals (for example, a Customer Loyalty Rewards) built in ODC that read core details from O11 but store their own operational data (rewards, catalogs) natively in ODC.

On the other hand, there are scenarios where extending with ODC may not be the right path. Follows some examples where you should continue developing in O11:

* **Extensions of existing O11 apps:** Adding few screens or UI components to an existing O11 application (for example, adding a new section to an existing Customer Portal), or making minor additions to a tightly coupled O11 system.

* **Heavy dependencies:** New applications that require a massive amount of O11 data and logic owned by different business owners, where the integration complexity would outweigh the benefits of the new platform.

## Getting started

Start extending your portfolio using [data interoperability](data-interoperability/intro.md).
