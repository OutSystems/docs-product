# Invalid Extension Error

The `Invalid Extension` error is issued in the following situation:

* `Change <parameter> default value in Integration Studio, go to Add/Remove References and refresh Extension reference`
  
    The definition of an Extension action has a default value for an input parameter that is not a literal.

    Open Integration Studio to edit the extension. Select the action, and change the default value of the parameter to a literal. In Service Studio you have to refresh this reference.
