# Transitioning to the OutSystems language

<div class="info" markdown="1">

To help you understand Service Studio, OutSystem's integrated development environment (IDE), the following short video introduces the IDE and its elements: [Service Studio: Walkthrough](https://learn.outsystems.com/training/journeys/web-developer-662/service-studio-walkthrough/o11/2352)

</div>

If you're already experienced in traditional 'hand coding' development, you may feel a little lost trying to learn OutSystems - primarily because it's not a matter of typing something else instead of what you are used to typing, but because you have to navigate a new visual IDE and you need to understand how what you are used to typing can be done within the OutSystems visual paradigm.

However, once you understand the basic OutSystems concepts and become familiar with the IDE, your learning and productivity can accelerate exponentially.

To help with the initial learning curve that many traditional developers encounter while transitioning to OutSystems, this section provides a few helpful documents:

* [Developer cheat sheet](resources/Developer-Cheat-Sheet-v0.6.pdf)
* [OutSystems main concepts](resources/OutSystems-Main-Concepts-v0.6.pdf)

**Note**: These resources are not meant to make you an expert in OutSystems - there is plenty of training and documentation for that.
