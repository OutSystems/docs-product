# Cannot open module

The Assessment Migration Toolkit cannot access and analyze the module, which blocks its preparation for the migration to ODC. This error can occur for several reasons, such as a corrupted module.

## How to solve

You must solve this pattern in O11 before proceeding with the code migration to ODC.

## **Solve in O11**

1. Try opening the module in Service Studio.

1. If the module opens successfully, look for issues like errors or outdated references.Â 

1. Fix the error and republish the module.

If you can't open the module in Service Studio:

Try publishing an earlier version of the module. In **Service Center** > **Factory** > **Modules** > search for module name > publish from the version list.

If this fails, contact the Early Access Program representatives to send it to OutSystems. OutSystems can then investigate the issue more closely.
