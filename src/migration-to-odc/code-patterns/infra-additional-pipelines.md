# Additional pipelines

OutSystems enables you to deploy [additional pipelines](../../setup-infra-platform/setup/possible-setups/infra-architecture/infra-architecture.md#pipelines) to isolate a portfolio of apps that have the same characteristics.

## How to solve

<div class="info" markdown="1">

If you are only preparing for the conversion, at present, OutSystems recommends that you focus on making your code and data ready for ODC. OutSystems is working on conversion automation capabilities for infrastructures with additional pipelines.

</div>

This pattern isn't supported yet.

Currently, O11 conversion to ODC is only supported for OutSystems 11 Cloud infrastructures with a single pipeline of environments.
