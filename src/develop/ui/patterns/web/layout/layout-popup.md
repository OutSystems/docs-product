# Layout Popup

The Layout Popup is a pre-existing web block useful for displaying additional off-canvas information. The web block is located in **UI Flows > OutSystemsUIWeb > Layouts**, and contains various placeholders and widgets that you can customize. You can then reuse and apply the web block to any of the screens in your app.
