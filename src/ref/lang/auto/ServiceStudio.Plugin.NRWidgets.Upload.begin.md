The Upload widget lets users browse and select a local file, which you can then upload to the server.

<div class="info" markdown="1">

Notes:

* Users can drag a file to the Upload widget in most **modern browsers**. However, they can't do it in Internet Explorer 11, as that browser doesn't support drag-and-drop.

* The widget can handle files up to 250MB. Larger files might not be loaded properly and end up empty, with a file size of 0 bytes.
