# Invalid Theme Error

The `Invalid Theme Error` is issued in the following situation:

* `The web flow cannot be the 'Error Handling Flow' of the theme because it has no error handlers`

    The Error Handling Flow property of the theme has a web flow that does not implement error handling.

    Change the web flow to have error handlers, or change the theme to user a web flow that already implements them.
