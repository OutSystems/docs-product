# Application Templates

OutSystems apps consist of modules that you bootstrap from an application template. These make development efficient because the apps based on application templates have many predefined elements. For example, login screens, a theme, layout blocks.

There are built-in, custom, and Forge application templates.

### Built-in application templates

**Reactive Web App**, **Phone App**, **Tablet App** and **Traditional Web** are the built-in application templates created and maintained by OutSystems. They reference the OutSystems UI Framework and enable you to use its theme, patterns, screen templates and other components.

### Custom application templates

These are the application templates you create, based on the UI framework of the source application templates. The document [Create a Custom Application Template](<../ui/reuse/create-a-custom-application-template.md>) explains how to create these templates.

### Forge application templates

These are application templates provided by the OutSystems Community and shared at [Forge](https://www.outsystems.com/forge/#category=templates).
