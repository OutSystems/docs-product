# Use Process Extended Actions

To manage the life cycle of your [processes](../process.md) or [process activities](../process-flow/process-flow-toolbox.md) of your module you're provided with **Process Extended Actions** and **Process Activities Extended Actions**. You can find them under your processes and process activities in the Processes layer of the module tree.


## Execute a Process Extended Action or Process Activity Extended Action

In the **Processes** layer of the **module tree**, drag the **Extended action** of the process or process activity and drop it on the action flow.

An extended action can have input parameters and output parameters.

### Input parameters

Instantiated when the action is invoked, through the `Arguments` property of the **Launch&lt;Process Name&gt;** element.

### Output parameters

You can use the output parameters of the **Launch&lt;Process Name&gt;** process extended action in one of the following ways:

* Type directly **Launch&lt;Process Name&gt;.Id**

    Example: after using the `LaunchPayment` action for the `Payment` process you can use `LaunchPayment.Id` to access the launched process identifier.

* Through the specific editors with access to the **Locals** folder

    Example: when editing an expression in the **Expression Editor**, the **Scope Tree** lists the **Locals** folder.

## Reference

The extended actions for the process and process activities are the following:

|Element   |Extended Action   |Description   |
|:----------|:----------|:----------|
| Process| Launch&lt;Process Name&gt;|Launches an instance of the Process.|
| Human Activity| Close&lt;Human Activity Name&gt;|Closes a Human Activity.|
| Wait| Close&lt;Wait Name&gt;|Closes a Wait activity.|
| Conditional Start| Start&lt;Conditional Start Name&gt;|Starts a Conditional Start activity.
