This pattern has been deprecated. If your Migration Assessment Tool still shows this pattern, please [download and update your Migration Assessment Tool](../setup-assessement-tool.md) to the latest version.

</div>

ODC now supports public roles. Thus, you no longer need to adapt your code for this pattern.
