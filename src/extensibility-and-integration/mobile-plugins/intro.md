# Mobile Plugins

When developing a mobile app you often want to use the capabilities of the mobile device, such as the GPS or notifications. You can achieve this in OutSystems using plugins. A plugin is a module that acts as a wrapper for an Apache Cordova plugin and enables you to use native mobile features.

You can find [ready-to-use plugins in Forge](<https://www.outsystems.com/forge/#category=plug-ins>), which contains both officially supported plugins and plugins created by the OutSystems Community. If you want to create your own plugins for use in mobile apps, do it by [wrapping an Apache Cordova plugin into a module](<using-cordova-plugins.md>).

## Using a mobile plugin

[Install the plugin](<../../getting-started/component.md>) in the environment as any other component. Use the client actions of the plugin module to call the native capabilities of the device within your application. The plugin must support the mobile platforms (iOS, Android) for which you are creating an app or the app generation will fail.

Each time you add, remove, or modify the plugin in an app, OutSystems [rebuilds the native shell](<../../deliver-mobile/mobile-app-update-scenarios.md#Situations_When_the_User_Must_Install_a_New_Build>) which you then have to distribute to the end users for installation.

You must [include the plugin license](<../../deliver-mobile/compliance-with-third-party-licenses.md#Include_the_Third_Party_Licenses_Used_by_Plug-ins_or_Components>) in your app to respect the license agreements of that plugin. These license agreements are usually placed in the About page of the app that uses them.

## What are the supported plugins provided by OutSystems { #Supported_Plugins }

This is the list of officially supported mobile plugins. Some of these plugins are already supported when distributing your app as a Progressive Web App (PWA).
