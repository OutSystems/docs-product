# Set up the OpenTelemetry Collector

This article explains how to set up the OpenTelemetry collector for Application Performance Monitoring (APM) tools that don't support native ingestion of OpenTelemetry data.

## Prerequisites

* Enabled [Log separation](../../setup-infra-platform/setup/logging-db/logs-separation-cloud/intro.md). 

* Installed Platform Server version 11.23.1 or higher.

* Installed LifeTime version 11.19.0 or higher.

To receive logs in Datadog or Splunk, you must set up an OpenTelemetry Collector:

1. Download the latest release of the OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib distribution, from [OpenTelemetryâ€™s GitHub repository](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/releases/tag/v0.87.0).

1. Install and deploy the OpenTelemetry Collector.

1. Set up the OpenTelemetry Collector.

    Add the APM tool exporter and security information to the collector config file. The configuration information varies depending on the type of the APM tool.   

1.  Run the OpenTelemetry Collector. 

**Note**: If the OpenTelemetry Collector implementation is OLTP over HTTP, according to the [OpenTelemetry specification](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otlp/#otlphttp-request), the default URL path for requests that carry log data is ``v1/logs``. If using OTLP/HTTP, you must add this path to the URL endpoint for a successful connection and data transfer.

## Example file with a basic configuration

The following configuration provides a basic working example for **Datadog**. It secures the OpenTelemetry Collector with basic authentication. 

   ```
    extensions: 
       basicauth/server:
          htpasswd:
            inline:
              user:password

    receivers: 
       otlp:
          protocols:
            grpc:
              auth:
                 authenticator: basicauth/server
    
    exporters:
      datadog:
        api:
          site: <DD_SITE>
          key: <DD_API_KEY>

    service:
      extensions: [basicauth/server]
      pipelines:
        traces: 
          receivers: [otlp]
          exporters: [datadog]
        metrics:  
          receivers: [otlp]
          exporters: [datadog]
        logs:
          receivers: [otlp]
          exporters: [datadog]

   ```
* Replace **DD_SITE** with your **Datadog site**. The default is **datadoghq.com**.

* Replace **DD_API_KEY** with your **Datadog API key**.
