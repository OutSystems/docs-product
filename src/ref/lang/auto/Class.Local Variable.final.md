# Local Variable


A Local Variable exists only in the scope of its parent element, for example, a Screen or an Action. A Local Variable can only be assigned and used locally inside that scope. Local variables are destroyed when execution leaves the scope of the parent element. The image below shows how to add a Local Variable inside a Screen.

## How to use

This example shows how to use a Local Variable to keep the value of a Search widget. The value of the Local Variable is then used to filter an Aggregate. 

1. Select the Input widget.

1. On the **Properties** tab, select the **Variable** dropdown and select **New Local Variable**.

1. Enter a name for the variable, for example `SearchKeyword`. Make sure the **Data Type** is set to `Text`.

1. Double-click the aggregate on the Elements tree.

1. On the **Filter** tab, click **Add filter**.

1. Insert the filter condition. 

    ```
    Employee.FirstName like "%" + SearchKeyword + "%"
    ```


1. To save the filter, click **Close**.

After you follow these steps and publish your module, you can test the functionality of the filter in your browser. The text inserted in the Input of the Search widget is stored in the defined Local Variable and is then used to filter the aggregate. When you change to another screen or close your browser, the Local Variable is destroyed and the filter no longer applies.
