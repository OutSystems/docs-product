# Section

<div class="info" markdown="1">

Applies only to Traditional Web Apps.

</div>

You can use the Section UI Pattern to organize on-screen content into different sections. This pattern can also be used with the Section Index UI Pattern to create anchors for each section.

**How to use the Section UI Pattern**

1. In Service Studio, in the Toolbox, search for `Section`.
  
    The Section widget is displayed.

    ![Screenshot of the Section widget in the Service Studio toolbox](images/section-1-ss.png "Section Widget in Service Studio") 

    If the UI widget doesn't display, it's because the dependency isn't added. This happens because the Remove unused references setting is enabled. To make the widget available in your app:

    1. In the Toolbox, click **Search in other modules**.

    1. In **Search in other Modules**, remove any spaces between words in your search text.
    
    1. Select the widget you want to add from the **OutSystemsUIWeb** module, and click **Add Dependency**. 
    
    1. In the Toolbox, search for the widget again.

1. To From the Toolbox, drag the Section widget into the Main Content area of your application's screen.

    ![Process of dragging the Section widget into the Main Content area of an application's screen](images/section-2-ss.png "Dragging Section Widget into Main Content")

    By default, the Section widget contains Title, Actions, and Content placeholders.

1. Add your content to the placeholders. In this example, we add a title to the Title placeholder, text to the Content placeholder, and a button to the Actions placeholder.

    ![Example of adding a title, text, and a button to the placeholders of the Section widget](images/section-3-ss.png "Adding Content to Section Widget Placeholders")

1. Add the desired action to the content you have added to the Actions placeholder. In this example, the button we added redirects the user to a new page.

After following these steps and publishing the module, you can test the pattern in your app.
