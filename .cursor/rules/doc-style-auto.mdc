# Documentation style auto-application

When the user asks you to **write** or **review** documentation content, apply the repository’s documentation styling rules by using these files as the source of truth:

* `.github/doc-styles/formatting.md`
* `.github/doc-styles/tone.md`
* `.github/doc-styles/structure.md`

If the task involves diagrams or other visual assets, also apply:

* `.github/doc-styles/visual-assets.md`

If the user did not run a command, still follow the rules above. If helpful, suggest using:

* `/doc-write` for writing tasks.
* `/doc-review` for review tasks.
