# Submit Feedback Window

In the Help menu, on the Menu bar, you have the ![Animated GIF showing the Submit Feedback operation in the Help menu](images/submit-feedback.gif "Submit Feedback Operation") Submit Feedback operation, which allows you to submit feedback, posting your comments or suggestions about Integration Studio or about the platform itself, directly to OutSystems. You just have to be connected to the Internet.

If the Submit Feedback Window has been automatically launched because Integration Studio generated an error or if your feedback regards a problem on which you need further assistance from OutSystems Technical Support, you should provide your email (which is optional). Once the feedback has been submitted, you receive a confirmation window like this:

At this point, if you only provided your feedback to collaborate with OutSystems in order to improve the product, just press the Close button. However, if you need further assistance and want to be contacted by OutSystems Technical Support regarding the problem you've submitted, you should click on the link of the window above which will open an email edition window.
