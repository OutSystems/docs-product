<td>Linguistic Sorting</td>
<td>Allows you to set the NLS_SORT parameter. Choose one of the following values:<br/>
BINARY_AI – Collation-sensitive SQL operations use a binary sort that is accent-insensitive and case-insensitive.<br/>
BINARY_CI – Collation-sensitive SQL operations use a binary sort that is case-insensitive, but accent-sensitive. Using this value can help prevent issues in languages where accents are relevant for SQL operations. For example, in Japanese "Seto" (セト) and "Zeto" (ゼト) would both be valid query results for the "セト" search when using the BINARY_AI linguistic sort.</td>
