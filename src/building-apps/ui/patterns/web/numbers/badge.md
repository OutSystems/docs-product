# Badge

<div class="info" markdown="1">

Applies only to Traditional Web Apps.

You can use the Badge UI Pattern to display numerical information as a notification. For example, the Badge UI pattern is frequently used to notify users about the number of unread emails, unopened messages, or new tasks they may have.

**How to use the Badge UI Pattern**

The Badge UI Pattern usually displays dynamic information. In most cases, prior to using this pattern, you will need [to retrieve or update the Data](../../../../data/intro.md) that contains the information you want to display onscreen. You do this by using an [Action](../../../../logic/action-web.md). 

The following example demonstrates how you can display the number of registered users on your platform.

1. In Service Studio, in the Toolbox, search for `Badge`.

    The Badge widget is displayed.

    ![Image showing the Badge widget in the Service Studio toolbox](images/badge-10-ss.png "Badge Widget in Service Studio")

    If the UI widget doesn't display, it's because the dependency isn't added. This happens because the Remove unused references setting is enabled. To make the widget available in your app:

    1. In the Toolbox, click **Search in other modules**.

    1. In **Search in other Modules**, remove any spaces between words in your search text.
    
    1. Select the widget you want to add from the **OutSystemsUIWeb** module, and click **Add Dependency**. 
    
    1. In the Toolbox, search for the widget again.

1. From the Toolbox, drag the Badge widget into the Main Content area of your application's screen.

    ![Screenshot of dragging the Badge widget into the Main Content area of an application screen](images/badge-11-ss.png "Dragging Badge Widget to Main Content")

1. From the Element tree, create a Preparation action by right-clicking on your screen, and from the drop-down, select **Add Preparation**.

    This Preparation action executes logic that fetches the data before the screen is displayed.

    ![Image illustrating how to add a Preparation action in Service Studio](images/badge-12-ss.png "Adding Preparation Action")

1. Select the **Data** tab, and from the Entities tree, navigate to the **User** entity and drag it onto the Preparation action.

    ![Screenshot showing the process of creating an aggregate for the User entity](images/badge-13-ss.png "Creating an Aggregate for User Entity")

    This creates an [aggregate](../../../../../ref/lang/auto/class-aggregate.md) that retrieves all of the users on your platform.

1. To reopen your screen, select the **Interface** tab, and double-click on your screen.

1. Select the Badge widget, and on the **Properties** tab, from the **Number** drop-down, select **Expression Editor**.

1. In the Expression Editor, enter the following expression and click **Done**.

    ``LongIntegerToInteger(GetUsers.Count)``

    Note: You can also add the expression by navigating through the Expression Editor's **Scope** tree and double-clicking on the **Count** output parameter. However, because the expected Badge [data type](../../../../../ref/data/data-types/available-data-types.md) (Integer) is different to the Count data type (Long Integer), to ensure the expression is correct, you must add `LongIntegerToInteger` to the `Get.Users.Count` expression.

   ![Image depicting setting the Number property in the Badge widget using the Expression Editor](images/badge-14-ss.png "Setting the Number Property in Badge Widget")

   The **Number** property is now set to display the Count property of the Aggregate you added to the Preparation action, which gets the number of users on your platform and displays them in your Badge.

1. On the **Properties** tab, you can also customize the Badge's look and feel by setting any of the optional properties, for example, the color, shape, and size. The following example displays a blue, small sized, circle badge.  

    ![Screenshot demonstrating how to customize the Badge's color, shape, and size](images/badge-15-ss.png "Customizing the Badge's Appearance")

After following these steps and publishing the module, you can test the pattern in your app.

For more information, see the [OutSystems UI Cheat Sheet](https://outsystemsui.outsystems.com/OutSystemsUIWebsite/CheatSheet).                                     |

## Additional notes

If the number on Badge Pattern is greater than 99, it is displayed as 99+.
