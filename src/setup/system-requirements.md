# OutSystems system requirements

<div class="info" markdown="1">

This article applies to: **OutSystems 11**&#8195;&#8195;Other versions available: [10](https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/10/Setting_Up_OutSystems/OutSystems_system_requirements)&#8195;[9.1](https://success.outsystems.com/Support/Archive/9.1/OutSystems_Platform_system_requirements)&#8195;[9.0](https://success.outsystems.com/Support/Archive/9.0/OutSystems_Platform_system_requirements)

</div>

Before installing OutSystems on-premises, check its hardware and software requirements. Once you're ready to start the installation, head to [Setting Up OutSystems](intro.md).

## Platform Server

This section summarizes the requirements for installing the Platform Server in your data center.

### Hardware (minimum requirements)

* Dual-core processor
* 4 GB of RAM
* 80 GB of free disk space

### Operating System

* Microsoft Windows Server 2019 (Standard Edition or higher edition), since Platform Server Release Jul.2019
* Microsoft Windows Server 2016 (Standard Edition or higher edition)

For these Operating System versions, OutSystems only supports Windows editions that are [supported by Microsoft](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/search).

The supported Operating System configurations must be deployed on bare metal or hardware virtualization technologies (for example, VMware or KVM).

Future revisions of OutSystems may require the installation of an update within the major versions mentioned in the previous list.

### Application Server

* Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) 10.0 or higher configured with a valid SSL certificate emitted by a public Certificate Authority

### Database Management System

Keep in mind that you must use the same flavour of database engine for the 3 databases used by the platform (platform and apps, logs, session). Combinations of database engines, for example, using SQL Server for the platform database and Azure SQL database for the logs and or session databases (or any other combination), are not supported.

* Microsoft SQL Server 2019 and compatibility level 150, since Platform Server 11.12.0 <sup>1</sup>
* Microsoft SQL Server 2017 (Web Edition or higher edition)<sup>1</sup>
* Microsoft SQL Server 2016 (Web Edition or higher edition)<sup>1</sup>
* Microsoft SQL Server 2014 (Web Edition or higher edition)<sup>1</sup>
* Azure SQL Database V12
* Oracle 19c (Standard Edition or Enterprise Edition), since Platform Server 11 – Release Oct.2019 CP3
* Oracle 18c (Standard Edition or Enterprise Edition), since Platform Server 11 – Release Oct.2019 CP2
* Oracle 12c (12.1 or 12.2, Standard Edition or Enterprise Edition)

<sup>1</sup> Developer and Express editions of Microsoft SQL Server (any version) are not supported.

Future revisions of OutSystems may require the installation of an update within the major versions mentioned in the previous list.

Apart from standard Oracle Database setups, OutSystems Platform 8.0 and onwards works with [Oracle Exadata Database Machines](http://www.oracle.com/us/products/database/exadata/overview/index.html) running with Oracle Linux 5.5 or higher.

### Additional Software Requirements

* Microsoft .NET Framework 4.8 (supported since Platform Server 11 – Release Oct.2019 CP2) or Microsoft .NET Framework 4.7.2
* Microsoft Build Tools 2015
* .NET Core 3.1 Runtime & Hosting Bundle for Windows

Future revisions of OutSystems may require the installation of an update within the major versions mentioned in the previous list.

## Cache Invalidation Service

OutSystems Cache Invalidation Service requires the following minimum version of RabbitMQ Server:

* RabbitMQ Server 3.9.11 with Erlang version 24.2, since Platform Server 11.15.0
* RabbitMQ Server 3.8.21 with Erlang version 23.2, from Platform Server 11.13.2 to 11.14.1
* RabbitMQ Server 3.8.3 with Erlang version 22.3, from Platform Server 11.9.0 to 11.13.1
* RabbitMQ Server 3.7.7 with Erlang version 20.3, for earlier versions of Platform Server

These versions can be upgraded to the latest minor version compliant with the [official documentation](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html).

During Platform Server installation, OutSystems provides you with a script that simplifies the local installation of these two components (RabbitMQ Server and Erlang). Alternatively, you can use an existing RabbitMQ Server and Erlang installation, as long as it fulfills the same version requirements.

## Amazon EC2 considerations

OutSystems can run on Amazon EC2 instances. Each instance must fulfill the following requirements:

* The EC2Config service must be running

For more information on how to enable this service check Amazon's [EC2Config service documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/ec2config-service.html).

## Amazon RDS considerations

OutSystems supports Microsoft SQL Server 2019 and compatibility level 150 (since Platform Server 11.12.0), Microsoft SQL Server 2016, Microsoft SQL Server 2017, Oracle 12c, Oracle 18c, and Oracle 19c on Amazon RDS. The database instance class must fulfill the following requirements:

* 1 vCPU (virtual central processing unit) or higher
* 1 ECU (EC2 Compute Unit) or higher
* 3.75 GiB of memory or higher
* "Moderate" network performance or higher

Example of a DB instance class fulfilling these requirements: "db.t2.medium".

Oracle 18c on Amazon RDS is supported since Platform Server 11 – Release Oct.2019 CP2.  
Oracle 19c on Amazon RDS is supported since Platform Server 11 – Release Oct.2019 CP3.

Check [Amazon's DB Instance Class](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.DBInstanceClass.html) topic for more information on the available DB instance classes. Be sure to also check [Amazon RDS System Requirements](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html) to learn about Amazon RDS limitations.
