## Deprecated map properties and how to migrate them

* **Markers**

    Instead of a Map block input parameter, Markers are now represented by blocks. [Learn how to add a list of markers to the map.](map.md)

* **StaticMap**

    To create a static map, use the [Static Map](intro.md) block.

* **ExtendedClass**

    To customize a map, use the [custom style classes](../../../../look-feel/css.md).
