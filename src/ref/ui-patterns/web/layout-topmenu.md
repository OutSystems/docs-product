# Layout Top Menu Reference

## Layout and classes

![](<images/layout-tm-1-diag.png>)

## Responsive behavior

This layout comes with a default responsive behavior. On tablets it remains the same as on desktop. But on phones it breaks the content vertically, making the placeholders Title and Actions full-width.

The menu also adapts to mobile, moving the navigation to a sidebar, toggled by a hamburger icon.

## Device compatibility

In Internet Explorer we made specific CSS that uses 'position: fixed' instead of 'position: sticky', as 'sticky' is not supported in Internet Explorer.

## Notes

In Internet Explorer 10 and 11, we added some specific behaviors to account for the flicker caused by the slow loading time of polyfill CSS Variables. If there are any JavaScript errors, this will cause the screen to appear white.

To override this behavior, add the following code snippet to your CSS theme:

```css
.ie10, .ie11 {
    display: block;
}
```
