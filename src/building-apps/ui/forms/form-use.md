# Use a Form to Group Input Widgets

You can use a Form widget to allow end users to enter data and store it in database records.

## In Reactive Web and Mobile

In a Reactive Web App or Mobile App, the screen must have an aggregate or a variable to hold the formâ€™s data.

To use a form to group input widgets in Reactive Web and Mobile:

1. Add the Form widget to the screen.

1. Drag the aggregate/variable to the form to create the inputs. A Save button is automatically added.
