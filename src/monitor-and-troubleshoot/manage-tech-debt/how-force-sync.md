# How to request a synchronization

<div class="info" markdown="1">

Architecture Dashboard is now AI Mentor Studio.

</div>

Synchronization of data between the AI Mentor Studio LifeTime probe and the AI Mentor Studio SaaS occurs every 12 hours, but you may also request unscheduled synchronizations. 

<div class="info" markdown="1">

There's a daily limit to the number of unscheduled synchronization requests that AI Mentor Studio can process for each infrastructure. You can request up to 5 unscheduled synchronizations after each scheduled synchronization.

</div>

To request an unscheduled synchronization, follow these steps:

1. Go to the AI Mentor Studio LifeTime plugin (`https://<lifetime_environment>/AIMentorStudioProbe/`) and select **Monitor**.

1. Select **Request Synchronization**.

After these steps, the synchronization request enters the **Outbound Queue** as **SyncRequest**.

<div class="info" markdown="1">

Select **Refresh** to update the queues and check changes to the status of **SyncRequest**.
