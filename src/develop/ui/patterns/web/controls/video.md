# Video

The Video UI pattern allows you to embed a native video player into your application.

Use Video as a powerful tool to engage users. But always remember to show all the essential information as text in the application.

<div class="info" markdown="1">
 
Note: if you want to stream videos from YouTube, Vimeo, or others, see the [How to Add Video to Your Applications](https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/Development_FAQs/How_to_Add_Video_to_Your_Applications) article.

**How to use**

In the Interface tab of Service Studio, drag the Video block from the Toolbox into your application's screen. At the Properties tab define the source video file to embed. All other parameters such as controls or size are optional.

1. Drag the Video pattern from the toolbox into the preview.

1. Set the SourceFile value:

    * If using an external source file, insert the file URL.

        ![](<images/video-image-3.png>)

    * If using a local file, include the video in a module as a resource and use the runtime path:

        1. In the **Data** tab, right-click the **Resources** folder and select **Import Resource**.

            ![](images/video-image-add-resource.png)
        
        1. Browse the video file and click **Open**.
        1. Go to the **Interface** tab and select the screen where you inserted the Video pattern.
        1. Select the Video pattern.
        1. In the **Properties** tab, click at the **SourceFile** field and type the runtime path ``"Resources.video-file-name"``. See an example below:

            ![](<images/video-image-runtime-path.png>)

    ![](<images/video-image-5.png>)

1. In the Logic tab, click on the OutSystems UI Web to go to the Video Folder.

    ![](<images/video-image-6.png>)

1. Drag the PlayVideo and PauseVideo actions inside the Play and Pause actions you created.

    ![](<images/video-image-7.png>)

1. For each server action, set the WidgetId parameter to the name of the Video pattern.

    ![](<images/video-image-8.png>)

1. Create the elements you want to act as buttons. You can also wrap icons around containers and set the OnClick to the Play and Pause actions.

1. Publish and test.
