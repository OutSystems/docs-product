# The Asset cannot contain multi-tenant modules

[Multi-tenancy](https://success.outsystems.com/documentation/how_to_guides/development/how_to_build_a_multi_tenant_application/) allows a single application server and database server to provide different customers with their own isolated set of computing resources. Currently, OutSystems Developer Cloud doesnâ€™t support multi-tenancy.

## How to solve

<div class="info" markdown="1">

If you are only preparing your code for the migration, at present, OutSystems recommends not making any changes to modules with findings for this code pattern, while ODC lacks built-in multi-tenancy support.

</div>

This pattern isn't supported yet.

You can only proceed with the migration of ODC assets without multi-tenant modules.
