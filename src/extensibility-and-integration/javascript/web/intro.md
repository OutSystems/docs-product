# Extend Your Web Application Using JavaScript

You can define JavaScript functions throughout your **web application** using three different scopes:

* Globally for the Module
* For a Web Screen
* For a Web Block

The local JavaScript can only be used within the Web Screen or Web Block where it is defined, while the JavaScript defined for the Module can be used in any Web Screen or Web Block of the Module.

<div class="info" markdown="1">

At runtime, the JavaScript code of the Module, Web Screens and Web Blocks is placed in a separate file which is included in each HTML page generated by OutSystems.

</div>
