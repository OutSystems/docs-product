# Get the source code of an application

<div class="warning" markdown="1">

This API is in technical preview. Customers are free to use it without costs as is. Changes to the API may occur, including pricing details that may be defined in the future.

</div>

The security of an app is an important aspect of an application development cycle. A common security best practice recommends that the code be analyzed statically (SAST).

OutSystems platform provides an API that enables you to download the generated code for the current running apps. The source code package returned by the API contains the server-side code and the native code, if itâ€™s a mobile application.

This enables you to request the source code of an OutSystems application and run-it against one of the in-house SAST tools.

<div class = "info" markdown="1">

The code shared in the API are almost same as the one running on the server. For security and licensing reasons, some files with configurations, secrets and proprietary code are not shared by the API.

<div class = "info" markdown="1">

The code in the package does not compile or is executable.

Extension code is not available through the API.

## Prerequisites

To download the source code of an app, ensure that the environment from where you want to get the source code has:

* Platform Server version 11.27.0 or higher
* LifeTime version 11.21.1 or higher
* [LifeTime Service Account](https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/11/Reference/OutSystems_APIs/LifeTime_API_v2/REST_API_Authentication)
    * Service Account needs Open and Debug on the environment

## Process Overview 

To request the source code of an application, follow these steps:

1. Get the **environment key** of the environment where you want to request the application source code (skip this step if you already have this information).
1. Get the **application key** of the application you want to request the source code (skip this step if you already have this information).
1. Get the **package key** of the application source code you want to request.
1. Check the **status** of the application source code packaging you want to request.
1. Once done, get the **download link** of the application source code package you want to request.
1. Download the application source code package you want to request.

Read the example API calls (requests and responses) below for each of the presented steps.

### 1 - Get the environment key

First, call the API method that returns all the environments available on your infrastructure (only necessary if we don't know the environment key yet):

Request: `GET /lifetimeapi/rest/v2/environments/`

Response body:

```
[
    {...},
    {
        "Key": "849515f2-b4ff-4aca-a9d6-9407bea655f4",
        "Name": "Testing",
        "OSVersion": "11.18.1.0",
        "Order": 2,
        "HostName": "hostname.outsystems.com",
        "UseHTTPS": true,
        "EnvironmentType": "Test",
        "NumberOfFrontEnds": 1,
        "ApplicationServerType": ".NET",
        "ApplicationServer": "IIS",
        "DatabaseProvider": "SQLServer",
        "IsCloudEnvironment": true,
        "IsOffline": false
    },
    {...}
]
```

In this request, the source code of an application is requested from the **Testing** environment. 

<div class = "info" markdown="1">

Note the environment key to use it in the upcoming API calls.

</div>

Example of an environment key: **849515f2-b4ff-4aca-a9d6-9407bea655f4**

### 2 - Get the application key

Next, call the API method that returns all the available applications in the infrastructure to get the application key. You can skip this step if you already have the application key. 

Request: `GET /lifetimeapi/rest/v2/applications/`

Response body:

```
[
  {...},
  {
    "Key": "c9a7a82e-0eee-4a3d-8e22-2a19c69c766f",
    "Name": "EmployeeBackoffice",
    "Kind": "WebResponsive",
    "Team": "",
    "Description": "",
    "URLPath": "/EmployeeBackoffice",
    "IconHash": "IconHash6a79e71e-c8e5-9e18-115c-cab789517672",

    "IsSystem": false,
    "AppStatusInEnvs": []
  },
  {...}
]
```

In this request, you request the source code for **EmployeeBackoffice** application.  

<div class = "info" markdown="1">

Note the application key to use it in the upcoming API calls.

</div>

Example "EmployeeBackoffice" application key: **c9a7a82e-0eee-4a3d-8e22-2a19c69c766f**

### 3 - Get the package key

Get the source code package key for an application on a given environment by the taking the API method "template" URL.

`POST/environments/{EnvironmentKey}/applications/{ApplicationKey}/sourcecodeaccess`

Replace the `{EnvironmentKey}` and `{ApplicationKey}` with values retrieved and make a request:

`POST /lifetimeapi/rest/v2/environments/849515f2-b4ff-4aca-a9d6-9407bea655f4/applications/c9a7a82e-0eee-4a3d-8e22-2a19c69c766f/sourcecodeaccess`

Response body:

```
{
    "PackageKey": "bc354abb-6691-41ee-9ed3-9454747e2d4d",
    "Status": "InProgress",
    "Messages": []
}
```

In this request, you request the source code for **EmployeeBackoffice** application.  

<div class = "info" markdown="1">

Note the package key to use it in the upcoming API calls.

</div>

Example package key: **bc354abb-6691-41ee-9ed3-9454747e2d4d**

### 4 - Check status

Get the status of the application source code packaging by taking the API method "template" URL.

`GET /environments/{EnvironmentKey}/applications/{ApplicationKey}/sourcecodeaccess/{PackageKey}/status`

Replace the `{EnvironmentKey}`, `{ApplicationKey}`, and `{PackageKey}` with values retrieved and make a request: 

`GET /lifetimeapi/rest/v2/environments/849515f2-b4ff-4aca-a9d6-9407bea655f4/applications/c9a7a82e-0eee-4a3d-8e22-2a19c69c766f/sourcecodeaccess/bc354abb-6691-41ee-9ed3-9454747e2d4d/status`

The response contains the link to download the source code package of the application.

### 6 - Download package

Use the URL obtained from [Use download link](#get-download-link) and get the source code package of the application. The download link is a call to a Lifetime API. The authentication token is mandatory for the request. The API method "template" URL used to download the application source code package is:

`GET /lifetimeapi/rest/v2/downloads/{DownloadKey}`

Replace the `{DownloadKey}` with the value on the download URL or call the full URL received from the step [Use download link](#get-download-link).

`GET /lifetimeapi/rest/v2/downloads/f4ee541b-5791-4997-a56d-360d80c24821`

If you are unable to download source code of the application, refer to [Unable to download the source code of an application article](https://success.outsystems.com/support/troubleshooting/application_lifecycle/unable_to_download_the_source_code_of_an_application). 

## Review results

When reviewing static code analysis results, you must note that each static code analysis tool can report findings without proper context. These findings must be reviewed to detect false positives. You can consult the experts in OutSystems development to help  understand these findings with proper context.

For more information about reviewing results and why certain finding should be considered false positives, refer to [Static application security testing](https://success.outsystems.com/support/security/static_application_security_testing/#review-results).
