# Generic external identity provider supporting OIDC

This article describes the generic configuration points to integrate with other identity providers.

The external IdP must implement the [OpenID Connect Discovery](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html). This enables the retrieval of configuration information from a well-known location as a JSON document (also known as a well-known URI).

The external IdP must support the following scopes:
* email
* openid
* profile
* offline_access

You must configure the authorization and refresh tokens in the external IdP. By default, the **prefered_username** claim matches the **username** field of the user configured in LifeTime.

The redirect URIs configuration is split into Web Applications (Consoles) and Native Application (Development Tools), but depending on the external provider, the redirects configuration can be configured together, like on Azure AD, or separately, like on Okta.


##  Integrating with OutSystems Consoles

To integrate with OutSystems Consoles, follow these steps:

1. **Sign-in redirect URIs**:

    * For each of the environments on your infrastructure (including Lifetime), add a new URI for the Service Center login page:

        * ``https://<YOUR_ENV>/ServiceCenter/CentralizedLogin_AuthCodeFlow_TokenPart.aspx``

1. **Sign-out redirect URIs**:

    * For each of the environments on your infrastructure (including Lifetime), add a new URI for the Service Center logout page:

        * ``https://<YOUR_ENV>/ServiceCenter/CentralizedLogout_CallbackEndpoint.aspx``

    * For the Lifetime environment, add a new URI for the Lifetime logout page:

        * ``https://<LT_ENV>/LifeTimeSDK/CentralizedLogoutPage.aspx``

## Integrating with OutSystems Development Tools

To integrate OutSystems Development Tools, follow these steps:

1. **Sign-in redirect URIs**:

    * ``servicestudio://auth``

    * ``integrationstudio://auth``

    * ``servicestudiox11://auth``

    * ``https://experiencebuilder.outsystems.com/Authentication/OIDC_Callback``

    * ``https://workflowbuilder.outsystems.com/Authentication/OIDC_Callback``

    * ``https://integrationbuilder.outsystems.com/Authentication/OIDC_Callback`` 

    * ``https://aimentorstudio.outsystems.com/Authentication/OIDC_Callback``

    * For each OutSystems environment in your infrastructure (excluding LifeTime), add an Integration Managerâ€™s URI:
        *   ``https://<YOUR_ENV>/OSIntegrationManager/OIDC_Callback``


1. **Sign-out redirect URIs**:

    * ``servicestudio://auth``

    * ``integrationstudio://auth``
