# Grid Dimensions Overflow Error

The `Grid Dimensions Overflow` error is issued in the following situation:

* `The widget dimensions must be set within the grid boundaries`
  
    The widget has the Width property set to 'col' and it is exceeding the number of columns defined in the theme's grid.
    
    Change the Width property so that the value is less than or equal to the grid size. Alternatively, change the Grid property of the theme to increase the number of columns of the grid.
