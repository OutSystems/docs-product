# Panel

You can use the Panel UI Pattern to group information in a small block, organized in different sections for title, actions, content, and a small footer that is easily noticeable.

Use a panel to group short pieces of information and highlight them on the screen with a specific structure.

**How to use the Panel UI Pattern**

1. In Service Studio, in the Toolbox, search for `Panel`.
  
    The Panel widget is displayed.

    ![](<images/panel-2-ss.png>)

    If the UI widget doesn't display, it's because the dependency isn't added. For example, if you are using a ready-made app, it deletes unused widgets from the module. To make the widget available in your app:

    1. In the Toolbox, click **Search in other modules**.

    1. In **Search in other Modules**, remove any spaces between words in your search text.
    
    1. Select the widget you want to add from the **OutSystemsUIWeb** module, and click **Add Dependency**. 
    
    1. In the Toolbox, search for the widget again.

1. To From the Toolbox, drag the Panel widget into the Main Content area of your application's screen.

    ![](<images/panel-3-ss.png?width=800>)

    By default, the Panel widget contains Title, Actions, Content, and Footer placeholders.

1. Add your content to the placeholders. In this example, we add a title to the Title placeholder, text to the Content placeholder, and a button to the Actions placeholder.

    ![](<images/panel-4-ss.png?width=800>)

1. Add the desired action to the content you have added to the Actions placeholder. In this example, the button we added redirects the user to a new page.

    ![](<images/panel-5-ss.png?width=800>)

After following these steps and publishing the module, you can test the pattern in your app.
