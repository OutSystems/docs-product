# Log Tab

The **Log** tab allows you to configure the logging database used by the platform and define advanced log settings.

The **Database Provider** (read-only) property contains the provider used to connect to the logging database. By definition, it's always the same provider as the one specified for accessing the platform database in the **Platform** tab.
