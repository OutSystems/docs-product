# Naming Elements in Integration Studio

An **element name** is a sequence of characters [Aa-Zz], numbers, and/or the character "\_"; spaces are not allowed. The name of the element must start with a character [Aa-Zz]. Any character that is not allowed, for example "space" or "รง", is automatically translated, by Integration Studio, to "\_".

The maximum number of characters allowed depends on the element you are handling:

* **Entity attribute name**: 28 characters.

    ![](images/warning.gif) If you are using an Oracle database, there are some reserved words that cannot be used as attribute names: `timestamp`, `number`, `blob`, `clob` and `varchar2`. Integration Studio presents a warning message notifying you that the attribute name must be changed.

* **Any other element**: 50 characters.

If the name is bigger than the maximum allowed, Integration Studio presents an error message and you must follow these limits in order to proceed.
