# Screen

Screen is an interface element that has other elements for user interaction. Use Screens to create web pages and mobile screens in your apps. Add a new Screen in the **New Screen** window. A new Screen can be empty or, if created from a [Screen Template](<../screen-templates-use/intro.md>), have some predefined content.

You can group the Screens into **UI Flows** of the **Interface** tab. An app created from one of the default Application Templates has the default **MainFlow** UI flow.

## Create an empty Screen

Follow these steps to create an empty Screen. An empty Screen has only the basic layout.

1. On the **Interface** tab, locate **UI Flows**, and in it **MainFlow**. Right-click **MainFlow** and click **Add Screen** (in Reactive Web and Mobile App) or **Add Web Screen** (in Traditional Web). The **New Screen** window opens.
1. Select **Empty** in the list.
1. Click **Create Screen**.

## Create a Screen from a Screen Template

Follow these steps to create a new Screen based on a [Screen Template](<../screen-templates-use/intro.md>). The resulting Screen contains the sample data that you can [replace manually or semi-automatically](<../screen-templates-use/replace-data.md>).

1. On the **Interface** tab, locate **UI Flows**, and in it **MainFlow**. Right-click **MainFlow** and click **Add Screen** (in Reactive Web and Mobile App) or **Add Web Screen** (in Traditional Web). The **New Screen** window opens.
2. Use the left side of the **New Screen** window to browse or search the Screen Templates. You can search by Widget names, use cases, tags, or categories.
3. Select a Screen Template by clicking the thumbnail.
4. Enter a title for the Screen in the **Screen name** field.
5. Click **Create Screen**.
