# Map

<div class="info" markdown="1">

Applies to Mobile Apps and Reactive Web Apps only

</div>

The OutSystems **Map** component allows you to add maps to your applications with single or multiple locations. The Map component is fully customizable, allowing you to, for example, change map behaviors, search for locations, and plan your route.

For more information on how to use the Map component, see [How to use the Map component](map.md).

## Static maps

Static maps are images that allow you to show simple maps. This type of map can be used in contexts where it is not possible to use a dynamic map, such as emails. Given its nature, it is not possible to interact with a static map or add elements, such as markers in runtime.
