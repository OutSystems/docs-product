# Dropdown

You can use the Dropdown UI Pattern to allow users make a choice from several options. Use the Dropdown UI Pattern to offer a choice of more than **four** options. The Dropdown UI Pattern is used when you want to display rich content, such as images. For a very large number of options, consider using the Dropdown Select UI Pattern to avoid loss of context.

**How to use the Dropdown UI Pattern**

In this example, we create a dropdown containing a list of employee names from an existing database. Once an employee is selected from the dropdown, a feedback message is displayed.

1. In Service Studio, in the Toolbox, search for `Dropdown`.

    The Dropdown widget is displayed.

    ![](<images/dropdown-1-ss.png>)

    If the UI widget doesn't display, it's because the dependency isn't added. For example, if you are using a ready-made app, it deletes unused widgets from the module. To make the widget available in your app:

    1. In the Toolbox, click **Search in other modules**.

    1. In **Search in other Modules**, remove any spaces between words in your search text.
    
    1. Select the widget you want to add from the **OutSystemsUIWeb** module, and click **Add Dependency**. 
    
    1. In the Toolbox, search for the widget again.

1. From the Toolbox, drag the Dropdown widget into the Main Content area of your application's screen.

    ![](<images/dropdown-2-ss.png?width=800>)

1. On the **Properties** tab, in the enter a name for the Dropdown widget.

    In this example, we enter `EmployeeDropdown`.

    ![](<images/dropdown-5-ss.png?width=800>)

1. Right-click your screen name, and select **Add Preparation**.  

    ![](<images/dropdown-6-ss.png?width=800>)

1. From the Toolbox, drag an Aggregate onto the Preparation.

    ![](<images/dropdown-7-ss.png?width=800>)

1. To add a database entity, double-click the Aggregate. Click the screen, and from the **Select Source** popup, select the database you want to use (in this example, the **Employee** database). Click **OK**.

    ![](<images/dropdown-8-ss.png?width=800>)

1. Return to your screen by double-clicking your screen name. From the Toolbox, drag the List Records widget into the **DropdownList** placeholder, and on the **Properties** tab, from the **Source Record List** dropdown, select the relevant record list.

    In this example, we select the **GetEmployees.List**.

    ![](<images/dropdown-9-ss.png?width=800>)

1. From the Toolbox, drag an Expression widget into the List Records widget, and on the **Properties** tab, set the **Value** property to the values you want to display in the dropdown.

    In this example, we set it to the employee names.

    ![](<images/dropdown-10-ss.png?width=800>)

1. To make each of the values in the dropdown selectable, right-click the expression, and select **Link to** -> **New Screen Action**.

    ![](<images/dropdown-11-ss.png?width=800>)

1. On the **Properties** tab, set the **Method** property to **Ajax Submit**.

    ![](<images/dropdown-14-ss.png?width=800>)

1. Double-click the new screen action, and enter a name in the **Name** property.

    In this example, we call it SelectedUser.

    ![](<images/dropdown-20-ss.png?width=800>)

1. Double-click the new screen action, and from the Toolbox, drag the **Run Server Action** onto the screen action. In the **Select Action** popup, search for and select the **Feedback_Message** and click **OK**.

    ![](<images/dropdown-12-ss.png?width=800.png>)

1. Set the message text and type.

    In this example, we set the message type to **Info** and set the message text to display the currently selected employee.

    ![](<images/dropdown-13-ss.png?width=800>)

1. Return to your screen by double-clicking the screen name. Right-click your screen name and select **Add Local Variable**. Enter a name and a default value for the variable.

    ![](<images/dropdown-22-ss.png?width=800>)

1. Drag the variable into the dropdown **Prompt** placeholder and enter a name and a value.  

    ![](<images/dropdown-21-ss.png?width=800>)

1. Double-click your screen action, add an **Assign**, and set the variable value. In this example, we set the variable to the currently selected employee.

    ![](<images/dropdown-3-ss.png?width=800>)

1. Add an **Ajax Refresh** to the screen action and in the **Select Widget** popup, select the widget you want to refresh.

    In this example, we select the expression that holds the currently selected employee.

    ![](<images/dropdown-4-ss.png?width=800>)

1. Select the **Logic** tab, navigate to **Interaction** -> **ToggleElement** and drag it onto the screen action. This closes the dropdown once a value is selected.

    ![](<images/dropdown-15-ss.png?width=800>)

After following these steps and publishing the module, you can test the pattern in your app.

![](<images/dropdown-19-ss.png?width=800>)
