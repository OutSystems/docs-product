# Onboarding developers

<div class="info" markdown="1">

To understand the IDE (Service Studio), it may be helpful to watch this short video introducing the elements around it first: [Service Studio: Walkthrough](https://learn.outsystems.com/training/journeys/web-developer-662/service-studio-walkthrough/o11/2352)

If you're already versed in traditional "hand coding" development, you may feel lost trying to learn OutSystems - primarily because it's not a matter of typing something else instead of what you are used to typing, but you have to be able to navigate around a new visual IDE (Service Studio), and also need to understand how what you are used to "typing" can be done within the OutSystems "visual paradigm".

Luckily, once you understand the basic OutSystems concepts and get used to how the IDE is laid out, we expect your learning and productivity accelerate at an exponential pace.

To assist with the "initial learning hump" that many traditional developers encounter while transitioning to OutSystems, this section provides a few helpful documents:
