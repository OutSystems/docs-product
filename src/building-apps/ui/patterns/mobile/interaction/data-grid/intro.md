# OutSystems Data Grid

The OutSystems Data Grid component allows you to view, explore, and edit large amounts of data in a familiar spreadsheet interface.

You can use the OutSystems Data Grid component to create enterprise-grade interfaces that are more suitable and time-effective than designing a custom solution every time you need to manipulate dense datasets.  

The OutSystems Data Grid component has the following key features: 

* Data selection and editing in a familiar interface 
* Data sorting by parameter 
* Data grouping 
* Virtual Scrolling 

The OutSystems Data Grid component is available to download for [Traditional Web apps](https://www.outsystems.com/forge/component-overview/5554/data-grid-web) and [Reactive Web apps](https://www.outsystems.com/forge/component-overview/9764/data-grid-reactive).
