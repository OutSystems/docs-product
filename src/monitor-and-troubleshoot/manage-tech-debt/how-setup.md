<div class="info" markdown="1">

Architecture Dashboard is now AI Mentor Studio.

</div>

![Screenshot showing how to change language settings in AI Mentor Studio by selecting the user name](images/select-language-ams.png "Selecting Language in AI Mentor Studio")

</div>

## Log in for the first time {#first-login}

You can log into [AI Mentor Studio](https://aimentorstudio.outsystems.com/) with your **OutSystems account** or with your **IT user account**. 

<div class="info" markdown="1">

IT administrators can enforce IT User authentication in a specific environment. If you’re logging into an environment with IT User authentication activated, you can only log in with your IT user account.

</div>

### Log in with OutSystems account {#os-login}

If you log in with your **OutSystems account**, AI Mentor Studio shows you the following welcome screen:

![Welcome screen in AI Mentor Studio for users logging in with an OutSystems account](images/welcome-os-ams.png "Welcome Screen for OutSystems Account in AI Mentor Studio")

Select one of the options shown on the welcome screen:

[Register and set up my infrastructure](#register)
:   Choose this option if your infrastructure isn't registered in AI Mentor Studio. You must have a LifeTime administrator role. If you don't have a LifeTime administrator role, you won't have this option available and you must ask your administrator to complete the setup.    

[Associate my IT user](#associate-os-login)
:   Choose this option if your infrastructure is already registered in AI Mentor Studio.  

[Use your IT user account](#it-user-login)
:   Choose this option if your administrator activated IT user authentication for your infrastructure.  

### Log in with IT user account {#it-user-login}

If you log in with your **IT user account** and your infrastructure isn’t registered yet, AI Mentor Studio shows you the following welcome screen:

![Welcome screen in AI Mentor Studio for users logging in with an IT user account](images/welcome-it-user-ams.png "Welcome Screen for IT User Account in AI Mentor Studio")

AI Mentor Studio shows you the option:

[Register and set up my infrastructure](#register)
:   Choose this option if your infrastructure isn't registered in AI Mentor Studio. You must have a LifeTime administrator role. If you don't have a LifeTime administrator role, you won't have this option available and you must ask your administrator to complete the setup.  

If you log in with your **IT user account** and your infrastructure is already registered, you’ll have to [associate your IT user](#associate-it-user-login).
