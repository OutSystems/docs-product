# How Integration Builder works

Integration Builder is a Software as a Service (SaaS) tool that connects to your OutSystems environment.

Integration Builder generates **integrations** for different external systems according to the configuration you provide. Each integration needs an associated **connection** that specifies the authentication used in runtime by the integration in an OutSystems environment.

After creating an integration and setting up a connection, use Service Studio to add calls to the Service Actions provided by the integration in your OutSystems apps.

## Architecture overview { #architecture }

![Diagram illustrating the architecture of Integration Builder, including components such as Integration Builder, Integration Manager, integrations, connections, and OutSystems apps.](images/architecture-diag.png "Integration Builder Architecture Diagram")

The main components involved in the Integration Builder architecture are the following:

* **Integration Builder** generates integrations that connect to external systems and publishes them to your OutSystems environment.

* **Integration Manager** is an OutSystems application that Integration Builder publishes to your OutSystems environment when you publish an integration. It manages connections and their association with integrations.
    Integration Manager communicates with Integration Builder to keep the status of integrations consistent and to get initial integration configurations. This happens in every environment to which you deploy the integrations.

* An **integration** is an OutSystems application generated by Integration Builder containing Server Actions to interact with an external system, according to the configurations you provide. Learn more about the [structure of generated integrations](structure.md).

* A **connection** is where you define the credentials or the type of authentication used in runtime to connect with an external system. Connections are defined in each OutSystems environment.
    Different external systems offer different ways of integrating with them. While some external systems support a basic authentication mechanism like Basic Authentication, other systems implement more complex authentication flows like OAuth.

* End users access an **OutSystems app** that you developed and published on your environment. This app calls Service Actions exposed by the integration to interact with the external system.

* It's unnecessary to connect Integration Builder to all your environments,
  although a connection to the development environment is mandatory. If you
  want to block Integration Builder from connecting to other environments,
  there are a few limitations:

    * Development Connections (created automatically by Integration Builder in
      a Dev environment for testing purposes) won't work. It's necessary to
      define your own connection.

    * Sending emails through Integration Manager to administrators to
      request new connections or assistants won't work.

    * Automatic creation of connections in Integration Manager won't work.
      Manual creation is still possible.

## Users

Integration Builder authenticates IT users by contacting your environment to validate the user credentials.

To use Integration Builder you must have an [IT user](../../manage-platform-app-lifecycle/manage-it-teams/intro.md) that has the [correct permissions](set-up.md#prerequisites) for the environment.

All IT users in your infrastructure that have these permissions can access and edit all integrations created and managed by Integration Builder.

Every OutSystems developer that can create applications in an OutSystems environment enrolled in the program can log in to Integration Builder. Every developer can see and modify all integrations created and managed by Integration Builder.

## Dependencies

Integrations created using Integration Builder include dependencies to the following Integration Builder apps:

* **Integration Builder Utils** - Includes utility actions used by integrations generated by Integrations Builder. It also includes static entities that you may use in your apps.

* **Common Shared Services** - Library with core methods that ensure better handling of platform data within some OutSystems components like the Case Management framework and Integration Builder. The [Common Shared Services is available in Forge](https://www.outsystems.com/forge/component-overview/9955/common-shared-services).

* **Secret Manager Local Service** - App that encrypts and decrypts strings as a local service. Integration Manager uses it to encrypt sensitive data, for instance, usernames, passwords, and API Key in SAP integrations, or consumer keys in Salesforce integrations.

* **Integration Manager** - App that manages connections and their association with integrations. Integration Manager communicates with Integration Builder to keep the status of integrations consistent and to get initial integration configurations. Integration Manager is deployed to every environment where you deploy integrations.

* **SharePoint Integration Utils** -  Includes utility actions used by SharePoint connectors generated by the Integration Builder. Includes Server Actions to handle documents, error messages, images, and validations.

<div class="warning" markdown="1">

* These dependencies are supported by OutSystems

* To ensure there aren't broken dependencies after updating dependencies to a version with breaking changes, Integration Builder forces the republishing of all affected integrations.

### Updating dependencies

To update dependencies, the IT user must have **Change and Deploy Applications** or higher permission assigned as a default role for the development environment.

<div class="info" markdown="1">

If you want to disallow a sub-set of Integration Builder users from updating dependencies, in LifeTime, [change the IT user permissions](../../manage-platform-app-lifecycle/manage-it-teams/about-permission-levels.md) for those users in one of the following ways:

* Assign these users the **Open and Debug Applications** permission for each dependency app. Learn more about [assigning roles for an app](../../manage-platform-app-lifecycle/manage-it-teams/about-permission-levels.md#role-assigned-to-users-for-a-specific-application).

    or

* Add these users to a team with **Open and Debug Applications** permission for each dependency app. Learn more about [assigning roles with a team](../../manage-platform-app-lifecycle/manage-it-teams/about-permission-levels.md#role-assigned-to-users-for-a-team).
