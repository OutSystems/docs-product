# How to edit data in the OutSystems Data Grid

This example shows how to edit data in the Grid using columns.

**Prerequisites:** 

* Complete [How to use the OutSystems Data Grid component](how-to-view-data.md).

1. Select the **Grid** component, and on the **Properties** tab, expand **Optional Configs** and set the **AllowColumnEdit** property to **True**. 

    This allows the Grid values to be edited.

1. Drag the relevant Column type to the **GridColumnsPlaceholder**. 

    In this example, the **Text Column** is used.

1. On the Text Column **Properties** tab, enter the **Header** and **Binding** information.

    The **Header** property displays in the columnâ€™s header. In this example, **"Name"** is entered. 
 
    The **Binding** property displays the name of the entity and the attribute in the column. In this example, the entity is called Sample_Product and the Attribute is Name, so the Binding property is **"Sample_Product.Name"**.

1. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for the Column widgets you want to display on your Grid. 

    This examples uses the following:

    | **Widget** | **Property** |
    |---|---|
    |**Number Column** | Header: "Stock" <br/> Binding: "Sample_Product.Stock"|
    | **Currency Column**| Header: "Price"<br/> Binding: "Sample_Product.Price" | 
    |**Checkbox Column** | Header: "Is Favorite"<br/>Binding: "Sample_Product.IsFavourite" |  

    ![Screenshot showing the Data Grid with added columns for Name, Stock, Price, and Is Favorite with their respective bindings.](images/grid-edit-addcol-ss.png "Adding Columns to Data Grid")
