# Customize the look of your app with Theme Editor

If your app uses a OutSystems UI Theme as a Base Theme, you can use Theme Editor to customize the overall style of your app and preview your customized app without leaving Service Studio.

To open Theme Editor, open a Screen and click the **Theme Editor...** icon in the workspace toolbar.

## Customize default colors of Screens and UI elements

Select one of the 18 default color palettes or use a custom palette based on the main colors from an image, like the logo of your company.

Once you select a color palette, Theme Editor sets a Primary color, a Header color, and a Background color. You can change each of these default colors by choosing one of the other three suggested colors or by defining a custom color.
