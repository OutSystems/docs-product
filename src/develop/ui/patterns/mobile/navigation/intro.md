Navigation patterns allow you to group related content together while helping users move around the app and locate specific features and information easily. For example, navigation tabs come from the idea of folders in a filing cabinet and therefore are familiar to the user. Navigation tabs provide a clear visual indication of what content can be found on an app and places the current location in context by highlighting it. Other navigation patterns include [Bottom Bar Item](bottombaritem.md), [Breadcrumbs](breadcrumbs.md), [Pagination](pagination.md), [Section Index](sectionindex.md), [Submenu](submenu.md), [Timeline Item](timelineitem.md), and [Wizard](wizard.md).
