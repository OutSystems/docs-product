Displays the records of an Entity or a Structure in a tabular layout and allows the user to create new records, update or delete existing records.

This widget has a set of built-in behaviors that provides an efficient way of adding and editing multiple records at once:

* Cycle through the inputs using the `TAB` key
* Save the record in the current row using the `ENTER` key or by using `TAB` in the last column of the row
* Add a new row and use the `ENTER` key to save that record and create a new one
* Cancel the edit or creation of the record using the `ESC` key
