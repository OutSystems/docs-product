* You installed the [latest windows-only version of the Development Environment](https://www.outsystems.com/downloads/). For now, you can't use use-case specific tutorials and accelerators with the macOS Service Studio.

## Creating and customizing your app

The key steps for creating a working use-case app that uses your data are the following:

1. Create and test the first version of your app by following the Service Studio tutorial for your use case. The first version of your app is functional and includes sample data. Check [this article to learn more about the first version of your app and about relevant OutSystems concepts](understand-create-app.md).

1. Next, make the app your own, by using your own data from an Excel file, an external database, or an external system of record (SoR). Check [this article describes the main external data sources you can use in your app](use-own-data.md).

1. Evolve your app by adding more screens using development accelerators specific to your app's use case.
