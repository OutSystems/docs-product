# How to get list of activities assigned to a case worker

Learn how to get a list of activities assigned to a case worker logged in to your app.
You can then use this list as the data source of a Table or List widget to enable case workers to see a list of the cases with activities currently assigned to them.

## Get list of activities assigned to logged user { #basic-list}

Before following the steps, make sure you have created the UI module of your app, named **&lt;app-name&gt;_UI**.

To get a list of activities assigned to a case worker logged in to your app, follow these steps:

1. In **&lt;app-name&gt;_UI**, open **Manage Dependencies**, and add the following dependencies:

    * From the **CaseServices_API** producer, add the **Case_GetActivities** action.
    * From the **CM_CaseServices_BL** producer, add the **ActivityAssigneeType** static entity.
    * From the **CM_CaseServices_BL** producer, add the **ActivityAssignmentStatus** static entity.
    * From the **CM_CaseServices_BL** producer, add the **ActivityProgressStatus** static entity.

1. In the screen where you want to display the list of activities, add a **Data Action**.

1. In the data action flow, add a **Case_GetActivities** service action.

1. In the properties pane of the **Case_GetActivities** action, click on **Expand ActivityScope**.

1. To get activities that the logged in user can work on, set **ActivityAssigneeType** as `Entities.ActivityAssigneeType.MyActivities`.

    <div class="info" markdown="1">

    This returns the following activities:

    * Activities assigned to the logged in user.
    * Activities assigned to a group the logged in user belongs to.
    * Activities that aren't assigned to a user nor to a group.

    </div>

1. To get activities assigned to the user, set **ActivityAssignmentStatus** as `Entities.ActivityAssignmentStatus.Assigned`.

1. To get activities that aren't done yet, set **ActivityProgressStatus** as `Entities.ActivityProgressStatus.Active`

1. Select the output parameter, and in the property pane set its **Data Type** to **ActivityResult list** by selecting **List...** > **NewCaseSearch\ActivityResult**.

1. In the flow, add an **Assign** after the **Case_GetActivities** action and name it to your preference.

1. In the **Assign**, add an assignment that sets the output parameter as  `Case_GetActivities.ActivityResults`.

After these steps, use the output parameter as the data source of a **Table** or **List** to show the information to the case workers.

## Add case information to the list of activities

You may need to show extra information about the case in the activities list, for example the subject line of a support ticket.

To add case information that's stored in the case business entity, make sure you have created a [Data Action to get a list of activities](#basic-list), and then follow these steps:

1. In **&lt;app-name&gt;_UI**, open **Manage Dependencies**, and from the **&lt;business-entity&gt;_CS** producer, add the case business entity as a dependency.

1. In the flow of the data action used to fetch the list of activities, set the output parameter's **Data Type** as a **List** of **Records** composed by the **ActivityResult** structure and the **&lt;business-entity&gt;** entity by doing the following:

    1. In the **Data Type** dropwdown of the output parameter, select **List..**.
    1. Select **Record..**.
    1. Select **Add attribute to &lt;output-name&gt;**, and add the following attributes:
        * `ActivityResult` with **NewCaseSearch\ActivityResult** structure data type.
        * `<business-entity>` with **&lt;business-entity&gt;** entity data type.
    
    ![Screenshot showing the process of adding ActivityResult and business entity attributes to the output parameter](images/list-activ-add-case-ss.png "Add Attributes to Output Parameter")

1. If you followed the [procedure to get list of activities assigned to logged user](#basic-list), delete the **Assign** from the flow.

    <div class='info' markdown='1'>

    This action is good practice but note that it will generate errors. These will be resolved when the remainder of the procedure is completed.

    </div>

1. In the flow, add a **For Each** after the **Case_GetActivities** service action.

1. Set the **Record List** of the **For Each** as `Case_GetActivities.ActivityResults`.

1. In the flow, add an **Aggregate** to fetch the data of the case business entity by dragging the **&lt;business-entity&gt;** entity next to the **For Each**.

1. Connect the **For Each** to the **Get&lt;business-entity&gt;** aggregate created in the previous step.

1. In the **Get&lt;business-entity&gt;** aggregate, add a **Filter**, and set it as `<business-entity>.CaseId = Case_GetActivities.ActivityResults.Current.CaseDetails.CaseId`, replacing &lt;business-entity&gt; by the name of your case business entity.

1. In the flow, add a **ListAppend** server action after the **Aggregate** created in step 6, and then connect the **Aggregate** to the **ListAppend** action.

1. In the properties of **ListAppend**, set **List** as the output parameter.

1. Select **Expand Element** (represented by the **+** next to **Element**), set **ActivityResult** as `Case_GetActivities.ActivityResults.Current`, and set **&lt;business-entity&gt;** as `Get<business-entity>.List.Current`, replacing &lt;business-entity&gt; by the name of your case business entity.

1. Connect the **ListAppend** action to the **For Each**.

After these steps, use the output parameter as the data source of a **Table** or **List** to show the information to the case workers.
