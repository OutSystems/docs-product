# Image Widget


Displays an image in the screen or block. The image source can be one of the following:

* A static image included in the module as a resource. The image is uploaded to the server when you upload the module. 

* An external image stored outside the platform that is accessible through a URL. When the screen is rendered, the image URL is processed, the image is fetched and displayed on the screen.

* An image stored in the platform database as Binary Data.

The supported image formats are GIF, JPEG, PNG and SVG. Please note that the images in the SVG format are not supported as Binary Data in the platform database.
