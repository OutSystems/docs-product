# Adapt SQL queries

In O11, you can choose to use SQL Server, Azure SQL Database, DB2, and Oracle as the platform database for your apps. In ODC, your apps use Aurora PostgreSQL. This means that after you migrate your O11 apps to ODC, you must modify all advanced SQL queries so that they are compatible with Aurora PostgreSQL.
