# User Avatar

You can use the User Avatar UI Pattern to display a user's initials or their image in a circular badge.

**How to use the User Avatar UI Pattern**

<!--The User Avatar UI Pattern usually displays dynamic information. In most cases, prior to using this pattern, you will need [to retrieve or update the Data](../../../../../develop/data/intro.md) that contains the information you want to display onscreen. You do this by using an [Action](../../../../../develop/logic/action-web.md). -->

The following example demonstrates how you can display the initials of the registered users on your platform.

1. In Service Studio, in the Toolbox, search for `User Avatar`.

    The User Avatar widget is displayed.

    If the UI widget doesn't display, it's because the dependency isn't added. For example, if you are using a ready-made app, it deletes unused widgets from the module. To make the widget available in your app:

    1. In the Toolbox, click **Search in other modules**.

    1. In **Search in other Modules**, remove any spaces between words in your search text.
    
    1. Select the widget you want to add from the **OutSystemsUI** module, and click **Add Dependency**. 
    
    1. In the Toolbox, search for the widget again.

1. From the Toolbox, drag the User Avatar widget into the Main Content area of your application's screen.

1. To create an aggregate (in this example to retrieve all the users on the platform), right-click the screen name and select **Fetch Data from Database**.

1. To add a database entity, click the screen, and from the **Select Source** pop-up, select the relevant entity and click **OK**. In this example, we select the **User** entity.

    The aggregate **GetUsers** is created.

1. To reopen your screen, select the **Interface** tab, and double-click on your screen name.

1. Select the User Avatar widget, and on the **Properties** tab, from the **Name** drop-down, select **Expression Editor**.

1. In the Expression Editor, enter the following expression and click **DONE**.

    `GetUsers.List.Current.User.Name`

    Note: You can also add the expression by navigating through the Expression Editor's **Scope** tree and double-clicking on the **Name** output parameter.

    The **Name** property is now set to display the Name property of the aggregate you created earlier, which gets and displays the names of the registered users on your platform.

1. On the **Properties** tab, you can also customize User Avatar's look and feel by setting any of the optional properties, for example, the color, shape, and size. The following example displays a blue, medium-sized, circle badge.

After following these steps and publishing the module, you can test the pattern in your app.
