# Raise Exception


Use Raise Exception to throw an exception and stop the currently running action flow. Set the **Exception** property to the exception you want to raise. You can select an existing exception or create a new User Exception.

When raising a User Exception, you must define the message to send as part of the exception in the **Message** property. The message is useful for logging purposes and eventually to display in the UI, informing the end user of the exception that occurred.

<div class="info" markdown="1">

Make sure that an exception message doesn't contain internal information before displaying it to end users.

</div>

The Raise Exception element ends an action flow. Therefore, it's not possible to include any elements in the flow after it. The execution continues from the [Exception Handler](<class-exception-handler.md>) that handles the exception raised by the Raise Exception element.

When you raise an exception, OutSystems follows an algorithm to determine what's the Exception Handler that it should execute. Check [Exception Handling Mechanism](../../../building-apps/handling-exceptions/handling-mechanism.md) to learn more about the chain of Exception Handlers that the platform looks for and executes when you raise an exception.
