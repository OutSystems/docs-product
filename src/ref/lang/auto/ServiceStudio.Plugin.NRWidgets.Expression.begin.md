The expression widget displays text or the result of an expression at runtime. It's similar to the **print** command in other programming languages. To use the expression widget:

1. In the widget toolbar, search for **expression** and drag the widget to a screen, block or placeholder. The expression editor opens.

1. Enter an expression in the expression editor and click **Done**.

    You can use one of these examples as the expression:
   
    * `"Hello, world!"`
    * `"1 + 2 = " + (1 + 2)`
    * `"The square root of 3 is " + Sqrt(3)`
    * `"Today is " + CurrDate() + "!" `
    * `ToUpper("this is text in uppercase")`


1. Publish the app and open the screen.

    Here is what you get if you use one of the examples in the previous step:

    * **Hello, world!**
    * **1 + 2 = 3**
    * **The square root of 3 is 1.73205080756887729352744634151**
    * **Today is 2020-10-08!!** 
    * **THIS IS TEXT IN UPPERCASE**
