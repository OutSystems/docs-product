# Queries

When developing your app, queries can help you find and work with data. A query can be, for example, a request for data results from your database or for action on the data. A query can provide an answer to a simple question, perform calculations, combine data from different entities, and add, delete, or change data from a database.

For more information about handling data using queries, see:

* [Aggregate](../../../lang/auto/class-aggregate.md)
* [Query Parameter](../../../lang/auto/class-query-parameter.md)
* [SQL](../../../lang/auto/class-sql.md)
* [Supported Join Types](supported-join-types.md)
