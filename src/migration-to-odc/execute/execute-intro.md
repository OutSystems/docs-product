One-shot migration is ideal for smaller, low-code projects with two or fewer business apps and up to 300 application objects. After completing the one-shot migration, you should have your:

* O11 app code, data, and end users migrated to ODC.

* O11 entities mapped to their ODC counterparts.

* Migrated, tested, and published ODC apps.

## Prerequisites

Before you start migrating apps, ensure the following:

* [The Migration Assessment Tool is set up](../setup-assessement-tool.md).

* [The O11 to ODC architecture mapping has been defined in the tool](../plan/plan-map-apps.md).

* [The O11 to ODC architecture has been validated](../plan/plan-assess-refactor.md).

* [The compatibility of your O11 apps with ODCÂ ](../prepare/prep-refactor-o11-apps.md)

## Step-by-step migration process
