You can use the Table Records widget to display the records of an entity or a structure in a tabular layout. You can define the table records as sortable making it easier for the user to read or find information faster. Record sorting can be fixed or dynamic, meaning that it can change during runtime. You can change the emphasis of a table row by changing its height and increase users' ability to read and interpret data in a table record by using zebra stripping. You can also use pagination to divide content and present it in a limited and digestible manner.
