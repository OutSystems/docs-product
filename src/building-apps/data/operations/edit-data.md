# Edit data while developing

After you [create entities to persist data](../modeling/entity-create.md), you can edit your app's data without leaving Service Studio.

Add, remove, and change records of **entities** during app development, enables you to do the following:

* Test your app with real and meaningful data to ensure your apps works correctly once it reaches your production environment.

* Prepare your demos with the right data to show your stakeholders real use cases and enable them to give you meaningful feedback.

<div class="info" markdown="1">

This topic relates to editing data of **Entities**, to learn how to edit data in **Static Entities**, check [Static Entities](../modeling/entity-static.md) and [Create and Use an Enumerate](../modeling/enumerate-create.md) topics.

</div>

## Prerequisites

To edit entity's data in Service Studio, ensure the following:

* You're connected to an environment that uses **Platform Server release 11.11.1** or later.

* You're connected to an environment with [Purpose](../../../setup-infra-platform/setup/environment-config.md#purpose) set as **Development** or **Non-Production**.

* Your IT user has [**Change and Deploy Applications**](../../../manage-platform-app-lifecycle/manage-it-teams/about-permission-levels.md) or higher for the module that contains the entity you are editing. 

*  If your environment uses [Multiple Database Catalogs and Schemas](https://success.outsystems.com/Support/Enterprise_Customers/Maintenance_and_Operations/Multiple_Database_Catalogs_and_Schemas), the entity must belong to a module published to the **(Main)** database catalog. This doesn't apply to **Platform Server release 11.14.1** or later.


### Entities whose data can be edited

In Service Studio, you can edit the data of **entities** that meet the following criteria:

* The entity has an **Identifier** attribute.
* The entity is a server entity. You can't edit the data of a client entity.
* If the entity is **Multi-Tenant**, the  **Show Tenant Identifier** property must be set as **False**, which is the default value.
* The entity isn't an exposed process entity.

## Adding changes

To start editing an entity's data, open the module where the entity exists. Then in the **Data** tab, double-click the entity, or right-click the entity and select **View or Edit Data**.

<div class="info" markdown="1">

Even though it seems like you're editing data in a spreadsheet, you're actually preparing changes to data in a relational database.<br/>
Rows represent entity records, and cells represent attributes.

</div>

In the entity Data screen, you can then [add rows](how-edit-data.md#add), [remove rows](how-edit-data.md#remove), and [modify cells of existing rows](how-edit-data.md#modify) to the entity. Changes aren't committed immediately, you can prepare several changes before applying them.

Service Studio adds an asterisk, **\***, to the first cell of rows that contain pending changes.

![Screenshot showing rows with pending changes marked by an asterisk in Service Studio](images/pending-changes-ss.png "Pending Changes in Service Studio")

If the change applies to specific cells of a row, Service Studio highlights that cell's background.

Service Studio continually validates your pending changes, and highlights cells with a red outline if it detects an issue.<br/>
Check the issue by hovering over the highlighted cell. Fix these issues before applying your changes.

If needed, you can [discard your changes](how-edit-data.md#discard) all at once, or one row at a time.

Once you [apply your changes](how-edit-data.md#apply), Service Studio creates and sends SQL statements to your platform database, changing one record at a time.

After trying to apply all your changes in the database, Service Studio lets you know if all changes were successful, or if any of the changes failed.

![Screenshot of Service Studio indicating successful data changes with a confirmation message](images/changes-successfully-ss.png "Successful Data Changes in Service Studio")
![Screenshot of Service Studio showing a message that some data changes failed](images/changes-failed-ss.png "Failed Data Changes in Service Studio")

If you don't apply or discard your pending changes, Service Studio keeps them saved in your machine.
