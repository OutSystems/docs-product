# Invalid Resource Error

Message
:   `Resource '<file>' is empty and cannot be stored in the Binaries directory in the Platform Server.`

Cause
:   The `<file>` is empty and therefore cannot be copied to the `Binaries` folder in the Platform Server. See [Resource Editor](<../../integration-studio/editor/resource.md>)
    
Recommendation    
:   You should [verify](<../../../integration-with-systems/integration-studio/extension-life-cycle/extension-verify.md>) your extension again in order to generate the DLL or JAR correctly.
