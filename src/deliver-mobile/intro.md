# Delivering Mobile Apps

Once your mobile app has reached a stable state, you should distribute it to your users.  
  
In OutSystems, there are two ways to distribute a mobile app:

* Generate a **mobile application package** (IPA and APK) for a target mobile operating system (iOS and Android). An OutSystems cloud service generates the packages for you, so you don't need the SDKs, only the configuration for the apps. Check the iOS and Android documentation to learn more about native builds and distribution to the Apple App Store and Google Play. 

* Activate the **progressive web app (PWA) distribution**. PWA is a lightweight distribution option for mobile apps, as it doesn't depend on the app stores and uses modern browser capabilities.
