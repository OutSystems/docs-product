# Accordion

<div class="info" markdown="1">

If you are using an OutSystems UI version lower than 2.8.2, please see the [Patterns and Versions Overview](https://outsystemsui.outsystems.com/OutsystemsUiWebsite/MigrationOverview).

</div>

You can use the Accordion UI Pattern to allow users expand and hide content when clicked.

**How to use the Accordion UI Pattern**

1. In Service Studio, in the Toolbox, search for `Accordion`.

    The Accordion widget is displayed.

    ![Accordion widget](<images/accordion-widget-ss.png>)

    If the UI widget doesn't display, it's because the dependency isn't added. For example, if you are using a ready-made app, it deletes unused widgets from the module. To make the widget available in your app:

    1. In the Toolbox, click **Search in other modules**.

    1. In **Search in other Modules**, remove any spaces between words in your search text.
    
    1. Select the widget you want to add from the **OutSystemsUI** module, and click **Add Dependency**. 
    
    1. In the Toolbox, search for the widget again.

1. From the Toolbox, drag the Accordion widget into the Main Content area of your application's screen.

    **Note:** By default, the Accordion widget contains 3 **AccordionItem** widgets. You can add or delete Accordion Items as required.

1. Add the relevant content to the **AccordionItem** placeholders. In this example, some FAQs are added.

1. On the **Properties** tab, you can customize the Accordion's look and feel by setting any of the (optional) properties.

After following these steps and publishing the module, you can test the pattern in your app.
