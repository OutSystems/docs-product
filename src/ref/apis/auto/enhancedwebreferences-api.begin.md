API to dynamically change Web Service and Web Reference URLs, SOAP headers, credentials, and proxies.

Use this API to customize requests of:

* exposed SOAP web services
* consumed SOAP web services that were upgraded to OutSystems 11

<div class="warning" style="overflow: hidden" markdown="1">

This API is **deprecated** and it will not work with the new implementation of **consumed** SOAP web services which supports up to SOAP 1.2. This applies to consumed SOAP web services that were created in OutSystems 11.

To customize requests of consumed SOAP web services that were created in OutSystems 11 you must use the [SOAP Extensibility API](<../soap-extensibility-api.md>).

</div>
