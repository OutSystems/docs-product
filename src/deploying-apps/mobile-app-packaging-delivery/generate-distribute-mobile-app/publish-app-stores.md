# Generate and Publish Your Mobile App to the Mobile App Stores

<div class="info" markdown="1">

Applies only to Mobile Apps.

</div>

At some point your mobile app is ready for production and so, to be used by end users. One of the ways you can distribute your production-ready mobile app is by providing it in the mobile stores for the general public.

In OutSystems, you can generate a mobile application package to publish your mobile app in the App Store and Google Play stores.

The following diagram shows a typical publishing process:

## Pre-requirements

When you have your application ready, it's time to publish it. Unlike publishing an app in OutSystems with one single click, publishing an app to a store requires several steps. Here are some pre-requirements to follow.

### Screenshots

Each application can have up to five screenshots and three previews, and you must provide at least one. If you are developing a universal app that runs on multiple devices, [you need to provide separate screenshots for each device](../customize-mobile-app/use-custom-splash-screens.md).

### Metadata

Before you submit your application, have your application's metadata at hand to use it later when publishing to stores. This includes:

* Your application's name
* The version number
* The primary (and an optional secondary) category. For example,  Finance / Mobile Banking
* A concise description
* Keywords
* A support URL

If you are submitting an update, then you can also provide some information in the **What's New** section.

### Product details

The product details are the app name, a short description and a full description of the application. You need to add these to the stores when publishing your app.
