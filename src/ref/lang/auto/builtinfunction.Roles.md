Available in:

## GetUserId { #GetUserId }

Returns the identifier of the user that is currently authenticated with the server or 'NullIdentifier()' if the user is not authenticated.  

Available in:  

  * Server-side logic: Yes
  * Client-side logic: Yes
  * Database: Function is evaluated before the aggregate is executed.
  * Local Storage: Function is evaluated before the aggregate is executed.

Note: Executing GetUserId() on an AfterFetch event is not recommended. For example, if a screen has multiple Data Actions or Screen Aggregates and one of these performs a login, as they're executed simultaneously, it is not possible to determine which one will override cookies last.

### Output

Type: UserId
