# Designing Waiting Activities

Use this pattern to design flow paths which, at some point, can only proceed the execution after some condition is verified. Use the [Wait](<../../../ref/lang/auto/class-wait.md>) activity to design this pattern.

The Wait activity holds the process execution until an event occurs, a timeout or database event, or if explicitly closed, using the **ActivityClose** action in an action flow.

To add business logic to validate whether the waiting is really to be ended or not, use the **OnClose** callback action of the Wait activity.


## Using Timeouts

A pattern to end a Wait activity is to set a timeout and then handle it accordingly.

### Example

As an example, think of a process to handle orders that starts provisioning ordered materials, packs them, and waits for the payment confirmation: if paid within 30 days of having the order packed and ready for shipping, the order is shipped, otherwise, the order is canceled.

## Using Database Events

Another pattern to end a Wait activity is to set the `Close On` property with a database event: the creation or the modification of an Entity record.

### Example

As an example, think of a recruitment process for candidates who apply for a job. At some point in the process, one interview is scheduled and the process waits for the interview to be updated with the feedback before continuing.

## Validating Whether the Waiting Ends

To add business logic to validate whether the waiting is really to be ended or not, use the **OnClose** callback action of the Wait activity.

### Example

As an example, think of a recruitment process for candidates who apply for a job. At some point in the process some interviews are scheduled and the process waits for all interviews have the feedback filled in.

![Flowchart example showing a recruitment process with multiple interviews, where the Wait activity uses the OnClose callback action to ensure all feedback is received before proceeding.](images/wait-on-close.png "Recruitment Process with OnClose Validation Example")

When the process is executed, every time an interview is updated, the Wait activity is (1) tentatively ended, executing the **OnClose** callback action to only allow it to end when all interviews have the feedback filled in.
