# Temporary OutSystems Cloud database backup

The access to a database backup service is designed to help our OutSystems Cloud customers recover their environments from unforeseen technical events, with significant business impact.

It's subject to our standard 15 days retention policy so you'll only be able to access a backup to a point in time within the last **15 days**.

Customers can extract the necessary data from a previous point in time or perform tests.


## Requesting the service

To request this service [open a support case](https://www.outsystems.com/tk/redirect?g=A82EA0CB-B101-4F08-BCFB-77559EF63801).

Please include:

- the point in time of the backup you want to access, specifying the precise date and time in UTC;

- the environments' address;

- the business justification for this request.

OutSystems may, at its own discretion, agree or decline to provide this service, based on the business justification. OutSystems won't provide this service on a regular basis, so you shouldn't include it in the design of your regular tasks or development processes.

## What will OutSystems deliver?

 - We will install the snapshot in a dedicated RDS database that's not connected to any OutSystems environment. This way, any operation performed in the temporary database won't impact your running production environment.
 - We will provide you with system admin credentials and the RDS database address that you can use to connect with a database client (such as SQL Server Management Studio or SQL Developer).

## For how long Iâ€™ll have access to the backup?

OutSystems will make this temporary database available for direct access by the customer for 1 week.

Upon OutSystems approval, this period can be extended when given proper justification.
