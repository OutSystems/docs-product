# Modal

You can use the Modal UI Pattern to interrupt the end user and demand an action. It is implemented to direct an end userâ€™s attention to important information. Ideal for when the end user is requested to enter information critical to continuing the current process.

**How to use the Modal UI Pattern**

For the purposes of this example, our app already contains a form where the user can enter their queries, and once they send their message, a confirmation message appears by using the Modal widget.

1. In Service Studio, in the Toolbox, search for `Modal`.
  
    The Modal widget is displayed.

    ![](<images/modal-5-ss.png>)

    If the UI widget doesn't display, it's because the dependency isn't added. For example, if you are using a ready-made app, it deletes unused widgets from the module. To make the widget available in your app:

    1. In the Toolbox, click **Search in other modules**.

    1. In **Search in other Modules**, remove any spaces between words in your search text.
    
    1. Select the widget you want to add from the **OutSystemsUIWeb** module, and click **Add Dependency**. 
    
    1. In the Toolbox, search for the widget again.

1. To From the Toolbox, drag the Modal widget into the Main Content area of your application's screen, and on the **Properties** tab, enter a name for the widget. In this example we enter `Confirmation`.

    ![](<images/modal-6-ss.png?width=800>)

    By default, the Modal widget contains Title, Icon, Content, and Footer placeholders.

1. Add your content to the placeholders. In this example we add text to the Title placeholder, text to the Content placeholder, and 2 buttons (Yes and No) to the Footer placeholder.

1. In this example, to open the Modal widget, we need to set the **Method** and **Destination** properties for the **Yes** button. To do this, select the **Yes** button, and on the **Properties** tab, from the **Method** drop-down, select **Ajax Submit** and from the **Destination** select **New Screen Action**.

    ![](<images/modal-8-ss.png?width=800>)

1. Enter a name for the screen action. In this example, we enter `ConfirmSend`.

    ![](<images/modal-11-ss.png>)

1. Select the **Logic** tab, navigate to **OutSystemsUIWeb > Modal** and drag the **ToggleModal** onto the screen action.

    ![](<images/modal-9-ss.png?width=800>)

1. On the **properties** tab, from the **WidgetId** drop-down, select the Id of the Modal widget. In this example, we select **Confirmation.Id**.

    ![](<images/modal-10-ss.png>)

1. In this example, to close the Modal, we need to set the **Method** and **Destination** properties for the **No** button. To do this, double-click your screen name, select the **No** button, and on the **Properties** tab, from the **Method** drop-down, select **Ajax Submit** and from the **Destination** select the screen action you previously created. In this case **ConfirmSend**.

1. On the **Properties** tab, you can change the Modal's look and feel by setting the (optional) properties.

After following these steps and publishing the module, you can test the pattern in your app.

The result of this example looks something like the following:

## Properties

| **Property** |  **Description** |  
|---|---|
| Position (PositionExtended Identifier): Optional| Set the position of the Modal on the screen. <p>Examples</p><ul><li>Blank - The modal is positioned in the center of the screen (Entities.PositionExtended.Center). This is the default.</li><li>Entities.PositionExtended.TopLeft - The modal is positioned top-left of the screen.</li></ul>|
| HasOverlay (Boolean): Optional | If True, an overlay is enabled behind the modal. This is the default. If False, there is no overlay. |
