# OutSystems main concepts

<div class="info" markdown="1">

The OutSystems Platform provides developers with a domain-specific language for developing and changing enterprise-grade web and mobile business applications.

This document summarizes most of the OutSystems language main concepts and their mappings to other development languages, including .NET/Javascript.

There is also a downloadable compact PDF of this content:
