# Log Tab

The **Log tab** allows you to configure the logging database used by the platform, as well as some advanced log settings.

The 'Database Provider' (read-only) property contains the provider that will be used for connecting with the logging database. By definition, it's always the same provider as the one specified for accessing the platform database in the Platform tab.
