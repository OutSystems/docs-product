# Documentation instructions (chunked)

This repository’s documentation writing and review guidance is split into smaller, focused files to avoid context overload.

## Source of truth

Use these files as the authoritative documentation style guide:

* `.github/doc-styles/formatting.md`
* `.github/doc-styles/tone.md`
* `.github/doc-styles/structure.md`
* `.github/doc-styles/visual-assets.md` (only when working on diagrams or other visual assets)

## Cursor commands

In Cursor, use these commands to automatically pull in the right chunks:

* `/doc-write`: Writing documentation (applies formatting, tone, and structure).
* `/doc-review`: Reviewing documentation (applies formatting, tone, and structure).

## If you cannot use commands

Include the relevant style files in your prompt (for example, by referencing the files above).
