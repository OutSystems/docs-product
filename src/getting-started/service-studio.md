# Service Studio Overview

When you open Service Studio to start developing your app, you must connect to an OutSystems environment. After you successfully connect, you will see the Environment tab where you can:

* Create a new application.
* Install applications and components from the OutSystems Forge.
* View and access your existing applications.

You can use the Search box in the Environment tab to find your application and modules, and also, to perform a search in the OutSystems Community. The Search box is available also on other screens, and the search scope will depend on the currently opened screen.

Once you create a new application or access an existing one, you navigate to the app detail screen:
