# Troubleshooting

## Apps aren't showing up in AI Mentor Studio

If AI Mentor Studio doesn't shown any apps, this can mean that there are synchronization issues between AI Mentor Studioand Discovery. 

Ensure that you installed the latest Discovery version.

If you have the latest Discovery version and the apps still donâ€™t show up, please contact the team via [Support Portal](https://www.outsystems.com/goto/submit-support-case).

## Synchronization issues

Synchronization (data sent from AI Mentor Studio Probe to SaaS) occurs every 12 hours.

In AI Mentor Studio, check the **Latest sync** date and time in the bottom right corner of the canvas.

If the last sync occurred more than 24 hours ago, go to the **Monitoring** tab of the Service Center of the LifeTime environment (`https://<lifetime_environment>/ServiceCenter`), and check for errors in the AI Mentor StudioLifeTime Probe module named **ArPr_Communitcation**.

Note that the **LifeTime environment** must be able to connect to AI Mentor Studio Web Service available at:`https://architecture.outsystems.com/Broker_API/ArchitectureDashboard.asmx`.

If the issue persists, open a ticket in the [Support Portal](https://www.outsystems.com/goto/submit-support-case) with all the details that you have and steps followed to troubleshoot.

## Duplicated code findings mismatch  

The number of issues listed in AI Mentor Studiois inconsistent across views. For example, the number of duplicate code instances in the report view differs from the number listed in the detailed view.

This may occur if you change the target environment of the code analysis probe without first deleting data from AI Mentor Studio. Before you change the target environment, contact [technical support](https://success.outsystems.com/Support/Enterprise_Customers/OutSystems_Support/01_Contact_OutSystems_technical_support) to delete existing data. Then follow the [setup procedure](how-setup.md) to configure the new target environment.
