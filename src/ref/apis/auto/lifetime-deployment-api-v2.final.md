# LifeTime API v2

The LifeTime API allows you to manage applications, modules, environments, deployments, users, teams, roles and deployment zones of your OutSystems infrastructure. Please bear in mind that what while the LifeTime UI and API deal with the same concepts, there are scenarios that are supported only via UI. All API operations are limited to the permissions associated with the Service Account used to call it, as defined in LifeTime. For operations on DB connections, the permissions are defined at the environment level. For more information about DB connection permissions, please refer to the following link: [Allow Integrations With External Databases](https://success.outsystems.com/documentation/11/managing_outsystems_platform_and_application_lifecycle/manage_it_users/allow_integrations_with_external_databases/).

## Version: v2

The LifeTime API allows you to manage applications, modules, environments, and deployments of your OutSystems infrastructure. Version 2 of the API adds support for deployment zones, users, teams, and roles.

Follow the guidelines presented in [REST API Authentication](<../lifetime-deployment/rest-api-authentication.md>) to authenticate your API requests.
