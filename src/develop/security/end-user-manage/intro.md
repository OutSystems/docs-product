# End-User Management

Use OutSystems Users application at `http://<environment address>/Users` to create, update and delete the end-users (users of your applications) and manage their roles. End-users need to have the required permissions to access an application secured with authentication.

OutSystems also offers the [Users API](<../../../ref/apis/auto/users-api.final.md>) to access end-user management programmatically. Use the API to write your own applications for managing end-users or for exposing APIs to external systems through Web Services.

If you use an external authentication method (e.g., Active Directory or SAML 2.0) to authenticate end-users, you do not need to create the users manually. Instead, they will be automatically created in the OutSystems database on the first login.  
Check [End-Users Authentication](end-user-authentication/intro.md) for more information on external authentication methods.
