# Stacked Cards

You can use Stacked Cards UI Pattern to add swipeable cards that can be dragged in multiple directions triggering events, such as deny, approve, and archive. This pattern is ideal when you want to individually scan multiple cards.

## How to use the Stacked Cards Pattern

1. In Service Studio, in the Toolbox, search for  `Stacked Cards`.

    The Stacked Cards widget is displayed.

1. From the Toolbox, drag the Swipe Events widget into the Main Content area of your application's screen.

    By default, the Stacked Cards widget contains a List, Overlay Top, Overlay Right, and Overlay Right placeholders.

1. Add content to the List placeholder. In this example, from the **Data** tab, we drag a list of Employees into the List placeholder.

    The **GetEmployees** aggregate is automatically created.

1. To create a swipe action for the OverlayLeft placeholder, select the pattern, and from the OnLeftSwipe **Handler** drop-down, select **New Client Action**.

1. From the Toolbox, drag a **Run Server Action** onto the client action, and from the **Select Action** editor, navigate to the action you want the swipe left action to perform. In this example, we use the **DeleteEmployee** action.

1. From the **Id** drop-down, select the action Id. In this example, the Id is the currently selected employee. This means, that when the user swipes left, the currently selected user is deleted form the list of employees.

1. Repeat step 7 for the OverlayTop (swipe up) and OverLayRight (swipe right) placeholders.

1. From the **Properties** tab, you can change the Range Slider's look and feel by setting the (optional) properties.

After following these steps and publishing the module, you can test the pattern in your app.
