The Switch Tool splits the action flow into two or more paths. The first action path whose connector evaluated as true will run. If none of the connectors is evaluated as True, the **Otherwise** path will execute. Double-click the connector label in the properties pane to open the Expression Editor and set the condition for that connector.

Use the label numbers to arrange the evaluation order (right-click on a connector and select **Move priority up** or **Move priority down**).
