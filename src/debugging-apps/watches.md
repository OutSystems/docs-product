# Watches

Watches allow you to examine module elements in Service Studio while debugging your module. These elements are always displayed in the **Watches** tab, regardless of being in or out of the scope of the element being debugged. This behavior contrasts with the rest of the [scope tabs](<debugger-ui-reference.md#scope-tabs-area>), where the displayed content depends on the current scope.

Using watches, you can inspect the following:

* Parameter values
* Variables
* Screen widgets


## Add a Watch

To watch a module element, follow these steps:

1. Run the module in Debug mode.
1. Right-click the element you want to watch.
1. Select the **Add To Debug Watches** option.

All watched module elements are alphabetically listed in the **Watches** tab.
