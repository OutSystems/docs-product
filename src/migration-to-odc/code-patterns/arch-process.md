# Asset consuming a Process

In ODC, business processes are available as [workflows](https://success.outsystems.com/documentation/outsystems_developer_cloud/building_apps/about_business_processes/workflows_in_odc/), which have a different architecture and may still have limited support when compared to [O11 BPTs](../../building-apps/processes/intro.md).

Thus, currently, ODC Assets can't consume Processes.

## How to solve

You must solve this pattern in O11, before proceeding with the code migration to ODC.

### Solve in O11

<div class="info" markdown="1">

If you are only preparing your code for the migration, at present, OutSystems recommends not making any changes to O11 BPTs. OutSystems is working on migration automation capabilities to map existing O11 BPTs to ODC Workflows.

If you have access to the Migration Kit, and want to unblock the migration of this ODC asset, you can consider the following:

* If you are doing a one-shot migration, replace the Process consumption with a placeholder Action. Once it's possible to automatically migrate O11 BPTs to ODC Workflows, you'll be able to migrate the missing Processes and BPT functionality.

* If you are doing an incremental migration, in the Producer app, create a REST Expose that wraps the Process. Then, in the consumer asset, replace the Process consumption with a Consume REST that consumes the Process REST Expose.
