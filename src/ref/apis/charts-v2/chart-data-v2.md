# Data

To add data to your chart you must input **DataPoint** labels and values for the **DataPointList** property.

There are two different ways to add data to the **DataPointList** property: **Fixed data** and **Variable data**.

## Populate your chart with fixed data {#populate-your-chart-with-fixed-data} 

1. From the Toolbox, drag a Chart to the Screen. 

    This example uses the Line Chart.

1. To create a list with one data point, click **+[0]** and set the **Label** and **Value** properties.
    
    These properties define the first data point of the chart. Each data point corresponds to a point on the chart. Optionally, you can also set the **SeriesName**, **Tooltip**, and **Color** for the data points.

1. To add more data points, repeat steps 2 and 3.

After following these steps, you can publish your module.

## Populate your chart with variable data {#populate-your-chart-with-variable-data} 

Before you start, make sure you have a List of data points to use in your chart. Each data point must include a label and a numerical value.

1. From the Toolbox, drag a Chart to the Screen.

    This example uses the Column Chart.

1. Map the **Value** and the **Label** of the **DataPointList** to the attributes from the List containing the data points for the chart.

    Optionally, you can also set **DataSeriesName**, **Tooltip**, and **Color** for the data points.
