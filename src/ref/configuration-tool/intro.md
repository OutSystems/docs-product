# Configuration Tool

Use Configuration Tool to configure your Platform Server. You can use the tool in basic installations, but it's particularly useful in more complex environments. Configuration Tool enables you to export the configuration scripts and inspect them.

This tool is only available in infrastructures managed by customers, such as on-premises installations.

To launch this tool, on your Windows desktop go to: **Start Menu** > **All Programs** > **OutSystems** > **Administration Tools** > **Configuration Tool**.

When you have more than one front-end server, make sure that the configuration is the same in each front-end server, except for the [Scheduler](<tabs/scheduler.md>) configuration.
