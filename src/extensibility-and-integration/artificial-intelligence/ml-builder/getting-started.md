# Getting started

<div class="info" markdown="1">

ML Builder is currently in a public **early access program (EAP)** and you need to register at the [ML Builder registration page](https://www.outsystems.com/eap-ml-builder/) to try it out.

</div>

To get started with ML Builder, do the following:

1. Sign in to the [ML Builder portal](https://mlbuilder.outsystems.com/) and register your non-production environment. When signing in, enter the name of your environment in **Environment**. For example, if the URL of the environment is **https://pp.example.com** enter **pp.example.com**. This is the **source environment** ML Builder connects to get data for training models.

1. [Create a model](creating-model.md) in the ML Builder app. Select your use case depending on what you want to predict, choose data, and let ML Builder create a model.

1. Validate and deploy your model in the overview page, to make the model available in your environment.

1. Implement the model in your app.

## Configuration { #configuration }

ML Builder requires Azure to create a model. The first time you log in, ML Builder asks you to set up your environment to work with Azure.

Follow the instructions in the wizard. You need the following configuration information:

* Subscription ID
* Application / Client ID
* Directory / Tenant ID
* Client secret
* Machine learning workspace and a training cluster
* Storage container and the connection string for storing data
