# Stream logs to Splunk

This article explains how you can set up log streaming from OutSystems applications to the **Splunk** APM tool.

## Prerequisites

* Enabled [Log separation](../../setup-infra-platform/setup/logging-db/logs-separation-cloud/intro.md). 

* Installed Platform Server version 11.23.1 or higher.

* Installed LifeTime version 11.19.0 or higher.

## Set up log streaming

To configure the OutSystems log streaming service, using **Splunk** as the destination tool, follow these steps:

1. [Configure Splunk to receive logs](#configure-splunk-to-receive-logs).

1. Set up the [OpenTelemetry Collector](configure-collector.md).

1. Get the OpenTelemetry Collector endpoint and authentication credentials.

Once you've completed these steps, go to LifeTime and [configure the log streaming service](lifetime-streaming.md). 

## Configure Splunk to receive logs 

1. Set up the HTTP Event Collector on Splunk (refer [here](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/9.0.1/Data/UsetheHTTPEventCollector) for instructions ).

1. Set up an OpenTelemetry Collector with a receiver that accepts HTTP or gRPC connections (refer [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/receiver/otlpreceiver/README.md) for example) and that uses the Splunk Exporter (refer [here](https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector/tree/main/examples/otel-logs-splunk) for example).

1. Change the collector version to the most recent release in the **docker-compose.yml** file, change the image parameter [http://quay.io/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector:0.67.0](https://quay.io/repository/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector?tab=tags&tag=0.67.0) to the latest numerated image found, for example, [quay.io/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector:0.79.0](https://quay.io/repository/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector?tab=tags&tag=0.77.0).

1. Add a transformation rule in the **otel-collector-config.yml** file by adding the following in the **processors** section.

    ```
    processors: 
    batch:
    transform:
    log_statements:
    - context: log
    statements: 
    - set(body, "Bodyfield is empty") where body == nil
    - set(body, "Bodyfield is empty") where body == ""

    ```

1. Activate the transformation rule in the **otel-collector-config.yml** file by adding transform in the **service/pipelines/logs/processors** section.

    ```
    processors: [batch,
    transform]
   
    ```
