# Errors and Warnings

While developing your applications, OutSystems validates your implementation and issues errors and warnings, depending on the severity of the problem.

Both errors and warnings can occur at any stage of the module life cycle like implementing some logic, designing a screen, testing a query, or publishing to the server.

For most [errors](../errors-and-warnings/errors/intro-errors.md) and [warnings](../errors-and-warnings/warnings/intro-warnings.md), double-clicking the error line in the TrueChange tab will take you directly to the source of the identified situation.
