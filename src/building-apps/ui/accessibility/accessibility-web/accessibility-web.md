# Accessibility in OutSystems Traditional Web Applications

<div class="info" markdown="1">

Applies only to Traditional Web Apps

</div>

OutSystems commits to allowing the development of enterprise-grade applications that meet the highest accessibility standards and guidelines. You have full freedom to extend the language and create custom-rich, accessible patterns and interfaces. You can do this by editing HTML markup and ARIA Roles. You can use either pure low code or traditional HTML and CSS for this purpose.

The accessibility of any application built with OutSystems ultimately depends on the developers and how they implement various elements such as images, links, forms, headings, and all other instances of content. This article aims to provide you with some best practices and guidelines to follow. It also demonstrates how you can leverage the accessible development accelerators that OutSystems provides.

To learn more about accessibility, see [Web Accessibility Perspectives Video (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3f31oufqFSM) or read [Accessibility Fundamentals](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/). This document helps you implement accessibility in your OutSystems applications by adhering to the rules in [WCAG 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20) to reach the different [levels of accessibility](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/conformance.html%23uc-levels-head).

## Guidelines for implementing accessibility

The following set of guidelines along, with the [standards and best practices guide](http://accessibility.arl.org/standards-best-practices/) by Web Accessibility Toolkit, helps you in developing more accessible applications.

### Have readable text with the correct contrast

Font size, text color and background color have a huge impact on applications if they don't follow the [WCAG guidelines for contrast accessibility](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-contrast.html). When [starting a style guide](https://www.outsystems.com/learn/courses/71/style-guide-architectures/) or building stylesheet rules for a pattern, make sure that:

  * Text under 24px should have a **minimum** color contrast ratio of 4.5:1
  * Text 24px or higher should have a **minimum** color contrast ratio of 3:1

To have WCAG-compliant color contrast ratio of text in your OutSystems application:

1. Select the element and go to its Styles Editor.

    ![Screenshot of OutSystems Styles Editor showing how to set color contrast ratio for text](images/accessibility-color-contrast.png "Setting Color Contrast Ratio in Styles Editor")

1. In the Font section, set the Size and Color.
1. In the Layout section, set the Color to change the color of that element's background. 
1. Use a [color contrast checker tool](https://contrast-ratio.com/) to check if the contrast ratio is acceptable.

Learn more about [accessible colors](http://accessible-colors.com/) or how to generate a color palette based only on background color and level of accessibility on the [Color Safe Website](http://colorsafe.co/).

**WCAG rules achieved:** 

1.4.1 - Use of Color (Level A) 

1.4.3 - Contrast (Minimum) (Level AA)

### Use heading elements correctly

Use headings correctly to organize the structure of your content and allow effective navigation through information.

Convert a container or placeholder to a heading using the tag "OSTagName" in the Extended Properties.

![Example of setting a container to a heading using OSTagName in Extended Properties](images/accessibility-image3.jpg "Using Headings for Content Structure")

For example, use the condition `OSTagName = "h1"` in the Extended Properties of the Title placeholder of a webscreen.

Learn more about [heading markup](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/headings/).

**WCAG rules achieved:** 

1.3.1 - Info and Relationships(Level A) 

2.4.1 - Bypass Blocks (Level A)

2.4.6 - Headings and Labels (Level AA) 

2.4.10 - Section Headings (Level AAA)

### Provide alternative text to images

In the Label property of the image, add a descriptive alternative text to make it accessible.

![OutSystems interface showing where to add descriptive alternative text to images](images/accessibility-image4.png "Adding Alternative Text to Images")

The resultant HTML is as follows:

```html
<img src="sample_image3.png" alt="Clear Coded Programming" title="Clear Coded Programming" width="150" height="150">
```
If an image is only present for decorative purposes, hide it from screen readers by leaving the Label property empty.

The resultant HTML is as follows:

```html
<img src="sample_image3.png" alt="" title="" width="150" height="150">
```

To use images inside a link or as buttons, set the alternative text to describe the link's destination or the button's purpose.

Learn more about [making images accessible](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/).

**WCAG rules achieved:** 

1.1 - Text Alternatives (Level A) 

1.4.5 - Images of Text (Level AA)  

1.4.9 - Images of Text (No Exception) (Level AAA)

### Group widgets inside forms

To group and organize widgets in forms, use the Fieldset pattern from OutSystems UI. 

1. Drag the Form widget to the screen.

    ![Illustration of dragging a Form widget onto the screen in OutSystems](images/accessibility-form-1.png "Form Widget in OutSystems")

1. Add as many Fieldset patterns as required.

    ![Demonstration of adding multiple Fieldset patterns to a form in OutSystems](images/accessibility-form-2.png "Adding Fieldset Patterns to Forms")

1. Add the required Input widgets in the Fieldset patterns and name them.
1. Add Label widgets next to the Input widgets.
1. To associate an input with a label, select the required input in the Input Widget property.

    ![OutSystems form showing how to associate an input widget with a label widget](images/accessibility-form-3.png "Associating Input with Label Widgets")

1. Publish and test.

You can learn more about [concepts to make forms fully accessible](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/forms/).

**WCAG rules achieved:** 

1.3.1 - Info and Relationships (Level A)

2.4.6 - Headings and Labels (Level AA) 

3.3.2 - Labels or Instructions (Level A)

4.1.2 - Name, Role, Value (Level A)

### Check that the outline of the link in focus is visible

Removing the outline using `:focus { outline: none; }` violates accessibility rules. If you must remove the outline, always provide alternative styling. 

To style the outline of a link in focus:

1. Click the CSS button in the Main Editor toolbar.
1. Select the tab with the application name.
1. Add the required style. The following CSS snippet has several options that you can use to provide alternative styling. 

```css
:focus { outline: thin dotted; } /* Style the outline */
:focus { background: #FFFF00; } /* Give it a background colour */
:focus { color: #FF6600; } /* Change the text colour */
:focus { outline: #FF0000 dotted medium; } /* Provide a custom outline */
:focus { color: #FFFFFF; background: #FF0000; } /* Go high visibility */
```

Learn more about [outline: none](http://www.outlinenone.com/).

**WCAG rules achieved:** 

2.1.2 - No Keyboard Trap (Level A)

2.4.7 - Focus Visible (Level AA)

### Have accessible layouts

The two types of default application templates in OutSystems—the TopMenu and the SideMenu—have layouts that are accessible, making sure they're interpretable by the browser and the screen reader.

![Preview of accessible TopMenu and SideMenu application templates in OutSystems](images/accessibilityui-image1.jpg "Accessible Application Templates")

HTML Semantics used:
`<header>, <nav>, <aside>, <main>, <footer>`

ARIA Roles used: 
`role="banner"` (header), `role="navigation"` (nav), `role="complementary"` (aside), `role="main"` (main), `role="contentinfo"` (footer)

### Have accessible keyboard interaction

One important aspect of accessibility is keyboard accessibility. It's essential for people with disabilities and useful for all. 

OutSystems UI implements accessible keyboard interaction in the UI Web Patterns. The keycodes used in the OutSystems UI Web Patterns are Space(32), Enter(13), ArrowLeft(37), ArrowTop(38), ArrowRight(39), ArrowDown(40) and Escape(27).

For custom interactive elements, you can implement accessible keyboard interaction as follows.

1. Add `keydown` or `keyup` event listeners to the interactive elements.

        element.addEventListener('keydown', myKeyboardInteractionFunction);
        element.addEventListener('keyup', myKeyboardInteractionFunction);


1. Set the `keycodes` to enable interaction.

        // if the user presses the Space key (keyCode: 32) or the Enter key (keyCode: 13)
        if (e.keyCode == "32" || e.keyCode == "13") {
            //code here

            e.preventDefault();
            e.stopPropagation();
        }

        //if the user presses the Escape key (keyCode: 27)
        if (e.keyCode == "27") {
            //code here

            e.preventDefault();
            e.stopPropagation();
        }
    
**WCAG rules achieved:** 

2.1.1 - Keyboard (Level A)

2.1.2 - No Keyboard Trap (Level A)

2.1.3 - Keyboard (No Exception)(Level AAA)

### Have accessible expandable and collapsible elements

Patterns with hidden and collapsible elements must use a custom script so that the change of view states are accessible.

OutSystems UI Web Patterns implement accessible expandable and collapsible elements.

**Commonly used ARIA states:** aria-hidden, aria-expanded, aria-controls, aria-labeledby, aria-label, aria-valuenow, aria-valuemin, aria-valuemax

**Patterns:** Accordion, Tabs, Alert, Tooltip, Dropdown, FloatingActions, NavigationBar, FlipContent

For custom expandable or collapsible elements, you can change or set Aria states. To do so, add the following code snippet to the JavaScript associated with the custom web block.

```javascript
// Set visibility through ARIA states

var setAriaState = function(element, ariaAttribute, ariaValue) {
     element.setAttribute(ariaAttribute, ariaValue);
};

// Call the function to change ARIA to specific elements

setAriaState(elementWrapper, 'aria-expanded', 'true');
setAriaState(elementItem, 'aria-hidden', false);
```

### Set the `tabindex` for accessible navigation

You can use the **Tab** key to navigate across elements in a web page. The `tabindex` attribute specifies the tab order or the navigation order of the elements.

You should fix the navigation order in the HTML code instead of using positive `tabindex` values. But there may be instances when the default tab order is misleading. If reordering elements and/or changing the stylesheet can't alter it, you can set specific `tabindex` values. Note that using `tabindex` to compensate for poorly organized source code is bad practice. 

If you have to set the navigation order using the `tabindex`, set the `tabindex` in the Extended Properties of the required element.

![OutSystems interface highlighting where to set the tabindex in Extended Properties](images/accessibilityui-image2.png "Setting Tabindex in Extended Properties")

Learn more about accessible [usage of tabindex](https://webaim.org/techniques/keyboard/tabindex).

**WCAG rules achieved:** 

2.1.1 - Keyboard (Level A)

2.4.3 - Focus Order (Level A)

### Extend containers and placeholders to implement accessibility

These widgets are powerful elements for developers to implement accessibility in their applications. You can make containers and placeholders work as HTML tags. To do this, add `OSTagName = "<html_tag>"` as an Extended Property.

![OutSystems interface showing how to extend containers for accessibility using Extended Properties](images/accessibility-image6.jpg "Extending Containers for Accessibility")

You can also extend these elements to receive ARIA roles, ARIA states, ARIA properties, `tabindex`, or change things based on variables on your screen.

![OutSystems interface showing how to extend placeholders for accessibility](images/accessibility-image7.png "Extending Placeholders for Accessibility")

![OutSystems interface demonstrating setting ARIA roles and properties for accessibility](images/accessibility-image8.png "Setting ARIA Roles and Properties")

## Web accessibility tools and references

You can use the following tools and references to check if your OutSystems applications comply with accessibility guidelines.

### WCAG guidelines

WCAG 2.0 and WCAG 2.1 are sets of stable guidelines that developers need to follow to make their content accessible to everyone (with and without disabilities).

* [WCAG 2.0 Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20) (published on December 11, 2008)
* [WCAG 2.1 Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21) (published on June 5, 2018)


### HTML and ARIA extensions

The use of non-semantic elements such as `<div>` and `<span>` with a class attribute isn't understandable by accessibility tools. Using HTML semantics clearly describes the meaning to browsers, developers and screen readers, and guarantees the accessibility of the content.

![Examples of HTML semantics used to improve accessibility in web content](images/accessibility-image9.jpg "HTML Semantics for Accessibility")

These are a few examples of HTML semantics: 

`<aside>, <figure>, <figcaption>, <footer>, <header>, <main>, <nav> , <section>, <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, <h6>`

See the [HTML Semantics cheat sheet](https://learn-the-web.algonquindesign.ca/topics/html-semantics-cheat-sheet/) to learn more.

To have a readable structure that's accessibility compliant, implement HTML semantics whenever possible. When impossible, use [ARIA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA) as an extension of HTML so that it's fully accessible.

WAI-ARIA (Web Accessibility Initiative's Accessible Rich Internet Applications) has roles, states, and properties to help developers describe the meaning of content and works as an extension of HTML. It allows developers to add specific attributes to HTML tags (such as alert or slider).

![Illustration of ARIA roles, states, and properties used to enhance web accessibility](images/accessibility-image10.jpg "ARIA Extensions for Accessibility")

See the [ARIA roles](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques#Roles), [ARIA states & properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques#States_and_properties) and [ARIA Landmarks](https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/NOTE-wai-aria-practices-1.1-20171214/examples/landmarks/HTML5.html) to learn more.
