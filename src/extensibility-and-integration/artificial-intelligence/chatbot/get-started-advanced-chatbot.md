# Create advanced logic and reply with cards

Create advanced logic and combine the power of the Azure AI provider with your existing OutSystems app and services. This document shows examples of advanced logic where the chatbot logic doesn't communicate directly with the Azure back end. Instead, you use the chatbot webhook module to handle and modify responses from Azure before the reply message shows in the UI.

To add logic that interacts with both Azure Bot Service and OutSystems, you need to [add and configure the chatbot webhook module](guide-outsystems-webhook.md).

## Reply with an echo message

After you create a new webhook module, it contains a logic for an echo chatbot. The logic accepts the message from the chatbot, appends "ECHO:" to it, and then sends it back as a chat reply.

Open your webhook module and go to **Logic** > **Server Actions** > **Utilities** > **GetMessageResponse**. Examine the logic in this Server Action.

## Reply with a card

Cards are UI elements that usually have images, buttons, and links to download attachments. They provide a richer experience than the plain text in chatbot conversations. The data structures in OutSystems OutSystems.AI Chatbot component follow the required structure of the Azure Bot Framework cards.

Create cards by building a response in the **GetMessageResponse** Server Action. We recommend that you install Demo Chatbot and open the logic related to the cards you want to use.

Here is more information about how to create a response, which is useful to understand as the logic combines elements from Azure Bot Framework.

### Available cards

The following types of cards are supported:

* Thumbnail Card
* Card Collections

You can combine elements in a card. Here are some of the elements:

* Thumbnail image
* Text
* Buttons
* Attachments 

### Cards structure

The chatbot cards are based on the Azure Bot Framework. The data structures corresponding to the JSON required by the framework are referenced in Azure Bot Framework Connector. You can see them in **Data** > **Structures** > **AzureBotFrameworkConnector**.

In the **GetMessageResponse** action you construct the JSON card structure that the connector sends to the Azure Bot Service. The message then shows in the bot UI. For more information about the cards, see these pages in in Microsoft Dev Center:

* [Cards reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/task-modules-and-cards/cards/cards-reference). Contains more information about cards. Note that not all cards are available in OutSystems.
* [Card actions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/task-modules-and-cards/cards/cards-actions) lists actions you can use with the cards.

## Reply with a card to download a file

Here is an example of a chatbot logic to send a PDF attachment in the chat window. When the user clicks the text in the chat window, the browser loads the PDF file. 

![Creating a chatbot response with a card](images/webhook-card-download-logic-sample-ss.png?width=600)

The bot logic usually has multiple branches, but this short example uses only one flow to focus on the logic of creating the download card. 

1. The **GetMessageResponse** Action has the following parameters:
    
    * **Message** - a default input parameter for GetMessageResponse. 
    * **ResponseMessage** - a default output parameter for **GetMessageResponse**. Note that one of the data types in **ResponseMessage** is **Attachments**.
    * **Attachment** - a local variable of the Attachment data type coming from the Azure Bot Framework Connector data structures (in **Data** > **Structures** > **AzureBotFrameworkConnector**).

2. The **Assign** tool sets the properties of the **Attachment** local variable. In this example:
    
    * **ContentType** - identifies the media type, here a PDF.
    * **Name** - the name of the attachment, which is the file label in the chat window.
    * **ContentUrl** - the link to the file. In this example, the file is a resource within the module and the link is relative.

3. An Action appends **Attachment** to the list **ResponseMessage.Attachments**. You may need to reference **ListAppend** Server Action from **System** producer (press **Ctrl+Q** and search for `(System)`).

4. The **Assign** tool labeled **Response Message** is a generic node that assigns the common values. It's part of the webhook module and comes with the default **GetMessageResponse** Server Action.

Once you run the example logic, the chatbot replies with the following message:

## Reply with a card that has and image and a button

Here is another example, which focuses on the logic overview and tha data structure. The bot logic usually has multiple branches, but this short example uses only one flow for better overview. 

![Creating a chatbot response with a thumbnail card](images/webhook-card-download-thumbnail-sample-ss.png?width=600)

1. **CardAction** local variable with **CardAction** data type corresponds to a clickable button, and in this **Assign** tool the values are assigned to it.
2. **ListAppend** action adds the **CardAction** variable to the list of buttons, in **Attachment.Content.Buttons**.
3. **Attachment.Content.Text** and **Attachment.Content.Title** define the text body and the title in the card.
4. **Attachment.ThumbnailUrl** points to the image URL and `Attachment.ContentType="thumbnail"` makes the image show as a thumbnail.
5. **ListAppend** action adds the **Attachment** variable to the list of attachments in **ResponseMessage.Attachments**.
6. **Response Message** is a generic node that assigns the common values of **ResponseMessage**.

Once the chatbot runs, it replies this message to the user:

## Reply with a multiple suggestions card

This is a card that offers several suggestions to the user. For more information, explore the chatbot demo app.
