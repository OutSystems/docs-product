# Stream logs to New Relic

This article explains how you can set up log streaming from OutSystems applications to the New Relic APM tool.

## Prerequisites

* Enabled [Log separation](../../setup-infra-platform/setup/logging-db/logs-separation-cloud/intro.md).

* Installed Platform Server version 11.23.1 or higher.

* Installed LifeTime version 11.19.0 or higher.

## Set up log streaming

To set up the OutSystems log streaming service, using **New Relic** as the destination tool, get the New Relic API key and the location for New relic account (U.S. or EU).

Once you have these values, go to LifeTime and [configure the log streaming service](lifetime-streaming.md).

Large 'message and 'exception.stacktrace' attribute values are truncated to 4,000 characters before streaming in order to follow New Relic's ingestion API limits. For more information, refer to New Relic's documentation on [Send custom events with our Event API](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/data-apis/ingest-apis/event-api/introduction-event-api/#limits).
