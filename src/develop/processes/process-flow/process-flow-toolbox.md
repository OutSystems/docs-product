# Process Flow Toolbox

When defining the process flow of your processes, Service Studio provides the following Tools:

| Tool      | Description    |
|:----------|:---------------|
| Start | Starts the process flow. Only one Start element is allowed in a process flow. |
| Conditional Start | Starts an alternative flow in the process flow. How to use a [Conditional Start](<../../../ref/lang/auto/Class.Conditional Start.final.md>). |
| Human Activity | Activity to be executed by a human being. How to use a [Human Activity](<../../../ref/lang/auto/Class.Human Activity.final.md>). |
| Send Email | Sends an Email to one or more recipients. How to use a [Send Email](<../../../ref/lang/auto/Class.Send Email.final.md>). |
| Automatic Activity | Executes an action flow to do some work without the need of human intervention. How to use an [Automatic Activity](<../../../ref/lang/auto/Class.Automatic Activity.final.md>). |
| Execute Process | Executes another process as an activity of the current process. How to use an [Execute Process](<../../../ref/lang/auto/Class.Execute Process.final.md>). |
| Wait | Puts the process flow execution on hold until a specific event occurs. How to use a [Wait](<../../../ref/lang/auto/Class.Wait.final.md>). |
| Decision | Branches the process flow path into multiple paths but only one is followed. How to use a [Decision](<../../../ref/lang/auto/Class.Decision.final.md>). |
| End | Ends the process flow. For a matter of organization, you can have more than one End element in the same process flow. How to use an [End](<../../../ref/lang/auto/Class.Process End.final.md>). |
| Comment | Allows you to add comments to your process flow. |

Each process activity created in your process flow using a process tool has a life cycle.
