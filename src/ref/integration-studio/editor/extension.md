# Extension Editor

The Extension Editor allows you to edit [properties](<../element-property/extension.md>) of your extension.

This editor is displayed when the extension is selected in the [Multi-tree Navigator](<../multi-tree-navigator.md>) or in the [Multi-tab Editor](<../multi-tab-editors.md>).

## Extension Elements

To manage the elements of your extension, see [Define Extension Actions](<../../../integration-with-systems/integration-studio/managing-extensions/action-define.md>), [Use Structures](<../../../integration-with-systems/integration-studio/managing-extensions/structure-define.md>), [Define Extension Entities](<../../../integration-with-systems/integration-studio/managing-extensions/entity-define.md>), and [Add a Resource](<../../../integration-with-systems/integration-studio/managing-extensions/resource-define.md>).

## Change the Extension Properties

You can change the properties of the extension at any time. Simply double-click in the extension node in the [Multi-tree navigator](<../workspace.md>) or select the extension tab in the [Multi-tab editor](<../workspace.md>).
