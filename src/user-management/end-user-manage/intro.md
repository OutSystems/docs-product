# End Users
An end user is a unique individual who uses your OutSystems apps. Each non-anonymous end user who interacts with your apps counts toward the end user capacities established on your subscription. People who develop your OutSystems apps but do not use them are not considered end users.

## Internal and external end users
You license internal and external end-user capacities separately on your subscription. Each end user of your OutSystems applications is classified as either internal or external. Internal is intended for employees and contractors of your organization. External is for your customers, partners, or other external parties who use your OutSystems apps.

By default in OutSystems, all end users are classified as internal until you configure the domains that you own. You only need to configure your domains when you license external end-user capacity on your subscription because doing so allows you to track the internal and external end-user counts separately. Within Service Center (for OutSystems 11), you can configure domains that you own. When you do this, all end users with email addresses belonging to these domains are classified as internal, and all end users with email addresses outside these domains are classified as external. For example, if your organization owns `example.com` and the end user's email is `adam@example.com`, then the end user will be classified as internal. Make sure to configure all the email domains used by employees who use your apps, including domains owned by your parent or affiliate organizations.  

In OutSystems 11, when an end-user has no email address stored on their profile, such as when you only capture a mobile phone number for the end user, this is counted as an internal end-user.

Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) and Managed Services Providers (MSPs) delivering apps to their clients should configure the domains of their clients (rather than the domains of their own company) as internal within Service Center. Internal and external end users are from the perspective of the client that is licensing usage of apps from the ISV or MSP, not from the perspective of the ISV or MSP that is licensing the OutSystems platform.

## Anonymous end users
Anonymous end users don't count toward the end user capacities specified in your subscription. Users who use your apps and who don't log in and also don't share any personally identifiable information (name, email, mobile phone, etc.) are anonymous. For example, people who visit your website (that is an OutSystems app) and just browse the information without logging in or providing personal information are anonymous end users.

## End user limits
OutSystems subscriptions typically include rights to run applications serving up to a specific number of internal end users and a specific number of external end users, with options for upgrading these end-user capacities that vary by subscription. When you exceed the internal or external end-user capacities specified on your subscription, you need to upgrade to remain in compliance with the license terms. Please contact your OutSystems sales representative for assistance.

Some customers have more than one production runtime in the same OutSystems 11 infrastructure where their apps are hosted and delivered to end users. Each production runtime in OutSystems 11 has its own independent database that tracks the end users who access apps hosted on that runtime. When the same individual accesses apps hosted on multiple runtimes, this individual is tracked as an end user in each and contributes to the reported end user count in each. Nonetheless, customers only need to license end-user capacities sufficient to cover the *unique* end users accessing apps within the same OutSystems 11 infrastructure.

## Managing your end users
You may periodically deactivate end users who you know won't continue to use your applications, and these users, once deactivated, will no longer count toward your licensed end-user capacities. For example, when an employee leaves, you would deactivate this user because they no longer need access to apps you've built for your employees.

You can [manage end users](accessing-users.md) through the **Users** console, which is available at `http://<environment address>/Users` or manage end users programmatically using the [Users API](../../ref/apis/auto/users-api.final.md).

## User providers
The **Users** module serves as the default user provider that enables single sign-on for end-users. It is possible to create and use other modules as user providers. In doing so, all modules using that user provider will share a source of user records and active sessions.

A user provider has a default tenant, which hosts the users that are created and managed by it. However, new tenants can be created to build multi-tenant applications. To learn more about multi-tenancy, refer to [How to build a multi-tenant application](https://success.outsystems.com/Support/Enterprise_Customers/Maintenance_and_Operations/How_to_Build_a_Multi-tenant_Application).

## Older subscription models
Versions prior to Platform Server 11.7.0 don't support classifying end users as internal or external, so customers should update to the latest version to take advantage of this. Older licensing models licensed "named" users, which didn't require end users to be classified as internal or external.
