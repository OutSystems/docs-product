Expression field
:    Edit your expressions in the expression field (1). Use **Ctrl+Space** to autocomplete a word or show a list of suggestions to use in the expression.

Toolbar
:    The buttons in the toolbar (2) are the operators developers use most often. Click the button to insert the element in the expression field.

Scope pane
:    The scope pane (3) shows the elements you can use in the expression, such as variables, built-in functions, and scripts. The availability of local elements depends on where in the app you're editing the expression. Note that only actions that you set as functions show in the scope pane.

Description pane
:    You can read the details about an element in the description pane (4). If a function has documentation, the documentation shows in the description pane.

Status
:     The expression status (5) tells you if the expression you're editing is valid or not.
