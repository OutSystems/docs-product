# Handle the submitted feedback


When you [enable user feedback for your apps](user-feedback-enable.md), the App Feedback application collects all the feedback your users send for each app. To act upon the feedback received, follow the steps below.

1. Open the LifeTime console at `https://<your environment>/Lifetime`.

    <div class="info" markdown="1">

    If you don't have LifeTime installed, access the App Feedback application of your environment by visiting the URL `https://<your environment>/ECT_Provider`.

    </div>

1. In the Applications section, select the **App Feedback** option in the drop-down menu next to the environment for which you want to see the feedback items.

1. Sign in with the credentials of a user account defined in the Users app (`https://<your environment>/Users`), that has Administrator or FeedbackManager permissions.

1. Click the **Feedback** section, to see a list of all the feedback submitted by users. 

1. On the right side of the screen, ensure the selection of the drop-down menu is **Open**. This option allows you to display open requests, closed ones, or both.

1. Select one of the listed feedbacks to check the information provided by the user, and click **Open**.

    A window with the details opens, providing the feedback from the user and screenshot of the app screen.

    1. Confirm this operation by clicking **Open Service Studio**. If you don't want to see this message again, click on the checkbox to automatically allow this operation.
