# Application Configuration Warning

Message
:   `Shared Configuration '<Shared Configuration>' is invalid and will be ignored.`

Cause
:   Your module is using a Shared Configuration with an invalid definition, so it won't be used in runtime.

Recommendation
:   Ask the application manager or the Service Center administrator to correct it with the Service Center Factory Configuration solution, available in the [OutSystems Community](<http://www.outsystems.com/community>), and republish the module, afterwards.
