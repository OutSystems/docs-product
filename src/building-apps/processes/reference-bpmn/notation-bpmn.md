# Notation Reference for BPMN Practitioners

OutSystems allows designing and executing business processes through [BPTs](https://www.outsystems.com/tk/redirect?g=ce023611-1cbc-4c61-a778-2a66167bc7ba). This technical note describes the notation used for Process Modeling targeted at practitioners currently modeling processes using BPMN.

| **BPMN 1.2** |**Description**|**OutSystems Business Process Technology**|**Description**|
|-------------|-----------|-------------|---------------|
|![BPMN icon representing a plain start event.](images/notation-reference-for-bpmn-practitioners-0.png "BPMN Plain Start Event")| Plain Start Event|![OutSystems icon representing a start event with a green play button.](images/notation-reference-for-bpmn-practitioners-1.png "OutSystems Start Event") |**Start**, initiates the process.|
|![BPMN icon representing a plain end event.](images/notation-reference-for-bpmn-practitioners-2.png "BPMN Plain End Event")| Plain End Event|![OutSystems icon representing an end event with a green square.](images/notation-reference-for-bpmn-practitioners-3.png "OutSystems End Event")|  **End**, finishes a process flow. Theprocess may continue in parallelflows.|
|![BPMN icon representing a terminate event.](images/notation-reference-for-bpmn-practitioners-4.png "BPMN Terminate Event")| Terminate Event|![OutSystems icon representing a terminate event with a green terminate label.](images/notation-reference-for-bpmn-practitioners-5.png "OutSystems Terminate Event")|  **End with Terminate property set to Yes**, ends all flows of the process.|
|![BPMN icon representing a start event with various catching triggers.](images/notation-reference-for-bpmn-practitioners-6.png "BPMN Start Event with Catching Trigger")| Start Event with a catching trigger: Message; Timer; Conditional; Signal or Multiple|![OutSystems icon representing a conditional start event with a lightning bolt symbol.](images/notation-reference-for-bpmn-practitioners-7.png "OutSystems Conditional Start")| **Conditional Start**, initiates an alternative flow and may be triggered by a DB event or an explicit API call.|
|![BPMN icon representing an intermediate event with various catching triggers.](images/notation-reference-for-bpmn-practitioners-8.png "BPMN Intermediate Event with Catching Trigger")|  Intermediate Event with a catching trigger: Message; Timer; Conditional; Signal or Multiple | ![OutSystems icon representing a wait event with an hourglass symbol.](images/notation-reference-for-bpmn-practitioners-9.png "OutSystems Wait Event")| **Wait**, pauses the flow waiting for a timeout, a DB event, an API call or for a custom business logic returning true.|
|![BPMN icon representing an intermediate event with various throwing triggers.](images/notation-reference-for-bpmn-practitioners-10.png "BPMN Intermediate Event with Throwing Trigger")| Intermediate Event with a throwing trigger: Message; Signal or Multiple|![OutSystems icon representing an automatic activity with a broadcast symbol.](images/notation-reference-for-bpmn-practitioners-11.png "OutSystems Automatic Activity")| **Automatic Activity**, can be used to broadcast an event (via DB) or call an API to deliver an event to a specific activity or process.                                                           |
|![BPMN icon representing a task of type service, script, or send.](images/notation-reference-for-bpmn-practitioners-12.png "BPMN Task of Type Service, Script, or Send")| Task of type: Service, Script or Send (if not email)|![OutSystems icon representing an automatic activity with a gear symbol.](images/notation-reference-for-bpmn-practitioners-13.png "OutSystems Automatic Activity")| **Automatic Activity**, performs custom business logic in the application or in external systems.|
|![BPMN icon representing a task of type user or manual.](images/notation-reference-for-bpmn-practitioners-14.png "BPMN Task of Type User or Manual")| Task of type: User or Manual|![OutSystems icon representing a human activity with a user silhouette.](images/notation-reference-for-bpmn-practitioners-15.png "OutSystems Human Activity")|  **Human Activity**, waits for a user or group to complete the given task.This activity shows up in the taskbox of one or more users.|
|![BPMN icon representing a task of type receive.](images/notation-reference-for-bpmn-practitioners-16.png "BPMN Task of Type Receive")| Task of type: Receive|![OutSystems icon representing a wait for receive event with an envelope symbol.](images/notation-reference-for-bpmn-practitioners-17.png "OutSystems Wait for Receive")| **Wait**, for the Receive semantics the application should call the Close Wait API when a message is received.|
|![BPMN icon representing a task of type send specifically for email.](images/notation-reference-for-bpmn-practitioners-18.png "BPMN Task of Type Send for Email")| Task of type: Send (for email)|![OutSystems icon representing a send email activity with an envelope symbol.](images/notation-reference-for-bpmn-practitioners-19.png "OutSystems Send Email Activity")| **Send Email**, sends a specified email message in the process flow.|
|![BPMN icon representing a reusable sub-process.](images/notation-reference-for-bpmn-practitioners-20.png "BPMN Reusable Sub-Process")| Reusable Sub-Process|![OutSystems icon representing an execute process activity with a play button symbol.](images/notation-reference-for-bpmn-practitioners-21.png "OutSystems Execute Process Activity")| **Execute Process**, runs a subprocess. The parent process only proceeds after all flows of the subprocess finish.|
|![BPMN icon representing an exclusive data-based decision gateway.](images/notation-reference-for-bpmn-practitioners-22.png "BPMN Exclusive Data-Based Decision Gateway")| Exclusive Data-Based Decision (Gateway)|![OutSystems icon representing a decision activity with a diamond symbol.](images/notation-reference-for-bpmn-practitioners-23.png "OutSystems Decision Activity")| **Decision**, directs to one outgoing gates based on custom business logic.|
|![BPMN icon representing an exclusive data-based decision gateway.](images/notation-reference-for-bpmn-practitioners-24.png "BPMN Exclusive Data-Based Decision Gateway")|Exclusive Data-Based Decision (Gateway)|![OutSystems icon representing a connector activity with a diamond symbol.](images/notation-reference-for-bpmn-practitioners-25.png "OutSystems Connector Activity")|  **Connector**, defines the execution order of activities in the flow.|
|![BPMN icon representing a parallel split fork.](images/notation-reference-for-bpmn-practitioners-26.png "BPMN Parallel Split Fork")|Parallel Split (Fork)|![OutSystems icon representing a fork activity with multiple arrows.](images/notation-reference-for-bpmn-practitioners-27.png "OutSystems Fork Activity")| **Fork**, two or more outgoing connectors (except when starting from a Decision) divide the flow into parallel paths.|
|![BPMN icon representing a fork and join using a parallel gateway.](images/notation-reference-for-bpmn-practitioners-28.png "BPMN Fork and Join using Parallel Gateway")| Fork and Join using a Parallel Gateway|![OutSystems icon representing a fork and join activity with multiple arrows converging.](images/notation-reference-for-bpmn-practitioners-29.png "OutSystems Fork and Join Activity")| **Fork and Join**, is implemented by calling a sub-process with the two or more parallel paths that must be joined. The parent process only proceeds after all flows of the subprocess have ended.|
|![BPMN icon representing a text annotation.](images/notation-reference-for-bpmn-practitioners-30.png "BPMN Text Annotation")| Text Annotation|![OutSystems icon representing a comment annotation with a yellow note symbol.](images/notation-reference-for-bpmn-practitioners-31.png "OutSystems Comment Annotation")| **Comment**, can be used to annotate any element or area of the process model.|
