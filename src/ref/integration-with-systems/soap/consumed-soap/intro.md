# Consumed SOAP Web Service

This section contains reference information on the elements of consumed SOAP web services. 

In [Legacy Implementation](<legacy/intro.md>) you can find reference information for the **deprecated** SOAP implementation (supporting up to SOAP 1.1) that is only available in modules upgraded from previous OutSystems versions.
