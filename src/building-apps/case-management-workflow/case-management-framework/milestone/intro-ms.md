# Defining intermediate goals with milestones

A milestone represents an intermediate goal in the context of the resolution of a case. Milestones provide modularity by helping define phases for dynamic cases, whose workflow isn't predictable and can't be fully defined while designing your app.

Achieving a milestone usually means the case meets conditions defined by you, like completing one or more activities, or achieving another milestone.
The achievement of a milestone can then trigger other actions in the case lifecycle like starting another process or assigning an activity.

In the Case Management framework a **milestone definition** is a type of milestone and a **milestone instance** is a specific occurrence of a milestone definition in the context of a case instance.
