# Translate your app

Translate the interface of your app to other languages to let more users use your app.

## Quick start

Here is a quick start to help you translate your app. To let the users use your app in their language, you need to:

1. [Add a new language and translate the text in the app](#adding-a-new-language-and-translating-the-text) by using the Service Studio translation editor.

1. [Create a language switcher](#creating-a-language-switcher) to let users change the language in the app.

1. If your app uses Static Entities, check [Working with Static Entities](#working-with-static-entities) for more information.

## Adding a new language and translating the text

To add a new language and translate your app, do the following in Service Studio:

1. Go to the **Data** tab and right-click on the **Multilingual Locales**. Then, select **Add Locale**. The **Select Locale** window opens.

2. Select a locale and then click **OK** to open the **translations editor**.

    ![Screenshot of the Select Locale window in Service Studio for choosing a new language](images/select-new-language-ss.png "Selecting a New Language")

    <div class="info" markdown="1">

    Make note of the language code, since you will need it later. For example, for **Portuguese (Brazil)** the code is **pt-BR**.

    </div>

3. In the translations editor, select the **Translate** option in the behavior list to see all text that needs translation.

    ![Screenshot displaying text that needs translation in the Service Studio translations editor](images/show-translatable-text-ss.png "Translatable Text in Service Studio")

    See [Translating with the translation editor](translation-editor.md) for more information on how to use the editor.

4. Translate the text in the **Translation in (language code)** column. Click **Done** when you are finished.

    ![Screenshot of the translation editor in Service Studio with a column for entering translations](images/enter-translation-ss.png "Entering Translations in Service Studio")
    
After you finish translating the text in your app, you then need to create a language switcher to show the available translations.

<div class="info" markdown="1">

Translate the text in **all modules of your app**. This is important as an app can have multiple modules with user interface elements.

</div>

## Creating a language switcher

A language switcher lets your users change the language of the app. To create a language switcher, do the following:

1. Drag a Link widget to a screen and enter the language name in the **Text** part of the **Link**. 

    ![Screenshot showing a Link widget with a language name in Service Studio](images/link-with-language-name-ss.png "Link Widget with Language Name")

    The example shows how to use the Link widget to change the app language. You can create the same action with other widgets, including Button and Dropdown.

2. Select the Link widget to view its properties. In the **On Click** list, select **New Client Action**. New Client Action opens for editing.

    ![Screenshot of Service Studio showing how to create a new client action for a language switcher link](images/new-client-action-for-link-ss.png "Creating a New Client Action for a Link")

3. With the logic editor open, go to the **Logic** tab and expand the **(System)** section in **Client Actions**. Locate the **SetCurrentLocale** client action and drag it to the logic flow.

    ![Screenshot of the Logic tab in Service Studio with the SetCurrentLocale client action highlighted](images/client-action-in-logic-tab.png "SetCurrentLocale Client Action in Logic Tab")

    <div class="info" markdown="1">

    If you can't find the **SetCurrentLocale Client Action**, you need to reference it first. Press **Ctrl+Q** to open the **Manage Dependencies** window and select **(System)**. In the right pane under **Client Actions**, select **SetCurrentLocale** and click **Apply** to confirm. You can now use **SetCurrentLocale Client Action** in your app logic.

    ![Screenshot showing the SetCurrentLocale client action in the Manage Dependencies window of Service Studio](images/set-current-locale-in-manage-dependencies.png "SetCurrentLocale in Manage Dependencies")

    </div>

    <div class="warning" markdown="1">

    Keep in mind that SetCurrentLocale **Server** Action doesn't work offline. Use **SetCurrentLocale Client Action** whenever possible.

    </div>

4. In the **SetCurrentLocale Client Action**, enter the code of the language (for example, `"pt-BR"`) in the **Locale** property.

    ![Screenshot of the SetCurrentLocale client action in Service Studio with the Locale property field highlighted](images/locale-in-client-action.png "Locale Property in SetCurrentLocale Client Action")

    <div class="info" markdown="1">

    If you have translations from **Static Entities**, add **Refresh Data** after **SetCurrentLocale**. For more information see [Working with Static Entities](#working-with-static-entities).

    </div>

5. Publish the app and select your link to change the language of the app.

## Editing existing translations

Use the [translation editor](translation-editor.md) to edit existing translations. You can also [export and import text for translation](translation-management.md). 

## Getting the identifier of the current language

You can get information about the current language with the [GetCurrentLocale built-in function](<../../../ref/lang/auto/builtinfunction-environment.md#GetCurrentLocale>).

![Screenshot showing the GetCurrentLocale function in Service Studio](images/get-current-locale-language-ss.png "GetCurrentLocale Function in Service Studio")

## Working with Static Entities

<div class="info" markdown="1">

Text Identifiers in Static Entities cannot be translated.

</div>

Follow these steps to translate the text in Static Entities and show the translation in the app.

1. In the [translation editor](translation-editor.md), search for the text you want to translate and set **Behavior** to **Translate**.

    ![Screenshot of the translation editor in Service Studio with a search for Static Entity text](images/static-entity-search-ss.png "Static Entity Search in Translation Editor")

2. While still in the translation editor, enter the translation in the **Translation in (language code)** cell and click **Done**.

    ![Screenshot of the translation editor in Service Studio showing the translation process for a Static Entity](images/static-entity-translate-ss.png "Translating Static Entity in Translation Editor")
    
    <div class="info" markdown="1">

    Translations for static entity records are defined in the same module as the static entity 
    records. The static entity records and the translations can then be referenced in a UI module.
    
    </div>

3. In the logic, to switch the locale, add **Refresh Data** just after the **SetCurrentLocale** action and select the Static Entity.

    ![Screenshot showing the Refresh Data action for a Static Entity in Service Studio](images/static-entity-refresh-ss.png "Refreshing Static Entity Data")

## Switching back to the default language

To let users switch back to the default UI language, [create a language switcher](#creating-a-language-switcher) that sets the locale code to **en-US**.
