# File Upload

<div class="info" markdown="1">

Applies only to Traditional Web Apps.

</div>

You can use the File Upload UI Pattern to allow users upload files to the app.

The File Upload pattern is commonly used in a form, but it can also be used as a stand-alone element.

**How to use the File Upload Pattern**

1. In Service Studio, in the Toolbox, search for `File Upload`.

    The File Upload widget is displayed.

    ![Image showing the File Upload widget in the Service Studio toolbox](images/fileupload-image-3.png "File Upload Widget in Service Studio")

    If the UI widget doesn't display, it's because the dependency isn't added. This happens because the Remove unused references setting is enabled. To make the widget available in your app:

    1. In the Toolbox, click **Search in other modules**.

    1. In **Search in other Modules**, remove any spaces between words in your search text.
    
    1. Select the widget you want to add from the **OutSystemsUIWeb** module, and click **Add Dependency**. 
    
    1. In the Toolbox, search for the widget again.

1. From the Toolbox, drag the File Upload widget into the Main Content area of your application's screen.

1. After following these steps and publishing the module, you can test the pattern in your app.
