You can use the Button Loading UI Pattern to call actions that don't run immediately, provide a visual hint, and disable the button from being clicked until it becomes available again.

**How to use the Button Loading UI Pattern**

1. In Service Studio, in the Toolbox, search for `Button Loading`.

    The Button Loading widget is displayed.

    ![Screenshot of the Button Loading widget in the Service Studio toolbox](images/buttonloading-widget-ss.png "Button Loading Widget in Service Studio")

    If the UI widget doesn't display, it's because the dependency isn't added. This happens because the Remove unused references setting is enabled. To make the widget available in your app:

    1. In the Toolbox, click **Search in other modules**.

    1. In **Search in other Modules**, remove any spaces between words in your search text.
    
    1. Select the widget you want to add from the **OutSystemsUI** module, and click **Add Dependency**. 
    
    1. In the Toolbox, search for the widget again.
    
1. From the Toolbox, drag the Button Loading widget into the Main Content area of your application's screen.

    In this example, we drag the widget onto a form that is already in the Main Content area.

    By default the **Button Loading** widget contains a **Button** widget. We change the text of the button to **Create New User**.

    ![Dragging the Button Loading widget onto a form in the Main Content area of an application's screen](images/buttonloading-drag-ss.png "Dragging Button Loading Widget to Form")

1. Create a new local variable (of Boolean type) to control the state of the **Button Loading** widget. In this example, we call it **CreatingNewUser** and set the default value to **False**.

    ![Creating a new local Boolean variable named CreatingNewUser in Service Studio](images/buttonloading-variable-ss.png "Creating a New Local Variable")

1. In this example, we also set the **ShowLabelOnLoading** property to **False**. 

    This displays the loading spinner only (not the Button label) while the button logic is being executed.

    ![Setting the ShowLabelOnLoading property of the Button Loading widget to False in Service Studio](images/buttonloading-setprop-ss.png "Setting ShowLabelOnLoading Property")

1. Double-click the **Button** widget and add the necessary logic. 

    In this example, the **ButtonOnClick** action creates a new user. We also add **Assign** logic for the **Button Loading** widget. The first Assign has the **CreatingNewUser** set to **True**. (This is so the spinner shows the loading state.) The second Assign has the **CreatingNewUser** set       to **False**. (The logic is added between the two Assigns.)

After following these steps and publishing the module, you can test the pattern in your app.

## Properties

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
|IsLoading (Boolean): Mandatory| If True, the button shows the loading spinner. If False, the button doesn't show the loading spinner.|
|ShowLabelOnLoading (Boolean): Optional | If True, the loading spinner displays beside the label. If False, only the loading spinner is displayed. This is the default.|
|ExtendedClass (Text): Optional| Adds custom style classes to the Pattern. You define your [custom style classes](../../../look-feel/css.md) in your application using CSS.<br/><br/>Examples <ul><li>Blank - No custom styles are added (default value).</li><li>"myclass" - Adds the ``myclass`` style to the UI styles being applied.</li><li>"myclass1 myclass2" - Adds the ``myclass1`` and ``myclass2`` styles to the UI styles being applied.</li></ul>You can also use the classes available on the OutSystems UI.
