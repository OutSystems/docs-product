# How to change module classifications

You can change a module's classification in the canvas. However, by changing the classification of a module, the classification of the app may be affected. OutSystems AI model receives this reclassification.

## Prerequisites

Before changing a module’s classification in Architecture Dashboard, make sure that the following requirements are met:

* You have [enabled AI auto-classification](how-enable-autoclass.md).

* You have [full control permissions assigned as a default role](how-works.md#maintenance-and-operations-permissions)

## Change module classifications

To change a module’s classification, follow these steps:

1. In the Architecture Dashboard canvas, double-click the app that contains the module you want to reclassify.

    When you reclassify the module classification, the **Change module classification** popup is displayed letting you know that all auto-classification for the module will be overridden.

1. Click **Yes, change it**. 

When you reclassify a module, the technical debt score related to architecture code patterns is recalculated immediately.
