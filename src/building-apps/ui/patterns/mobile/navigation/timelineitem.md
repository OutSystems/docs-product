# Timeline Item

<div class="info" markdown="1">

Applies to Mobile Apps and Reactive Web Apps only

</div>

You can use the Timeline Item UI Pattern to show related events in a chronological order, such as a user's upcoming, current, and past activities.

**How to use the Timeline Item UI Pattern**

1. In Service Studio, in the Toolbox, search for `Timeline Item`.

    The Timeline Item widget is displayed.

    ![Screenshot of the Timeline Item widget found in the Service Studio toolbox](images/timelineitem-2-ss.png "Timeline Item Widget in Service Studio")

    If the UI widget doesn't display, it's because the dependency isn't added. This happens because the Remove unused references setting is enabled. To make the widget available in your app:

    1. In the Toolbox, click **Search in other modules**.

    1. In **Search in other Modules**, remove any spaces between words in your search text.

    1. Select the widget you want to add from the **OutSystemsUI** module, and click **Add Dependency**. 

    1. In the Toolbox, search for the widget again.

1. From the Toolbox, drag the Timeline widget onto your application's screen.

    By default, the Timeline Item widget contains Left, Icon, Title, Content, and Right placeholders. You can add as many Timeline Item widgets as required.

    In this example we add two more Timeline Item widgets.

1. Set the required content in each of the placeholders.

    In this example we add some icons and text.

After following these steps and publishing the module, you can test the pattern in your app.
