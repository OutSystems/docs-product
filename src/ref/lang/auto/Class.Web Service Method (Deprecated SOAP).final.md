# Web Service Method (Deprecated SOAP)

Method of a consumed SOAP 1.1 Web Service.

<div class="info" markdown="1">

This consumed SOAP Web Service implementation is **deprecated** and it's only available in modules that have been upgraded to OutSystems 11. 

New Consumed SOAP Web Service elements created in OutSystems 11 modules follow the [new SOAP implementation](<ServiceStudio.Plugin.SOAP.SOAPClient.final.md>) supporting up to SOAP 1.2.
