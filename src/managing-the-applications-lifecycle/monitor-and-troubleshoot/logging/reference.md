# Log data reference

This document lists the fields and descriptions of the database views associated with the platform log records. The views are built on top of the database tables.

<div class="info" markdown="1">

Also available: [Log data reference in OutSystems 10](https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/10/Managing_the_Applications_Lifecycle/Monitor_and_Troubleshoot/Logging_database_and_architecture/Log_data_reference).

</div>

## Mapping of the database views and Entities

You can access the log data in Service Studio, by using the PlatformLogs extension. Each entry has the corresponding _Previous entry. For example, for the oslog_General view you have both oslog_General_Previous in the database views and Log_General_Previous in the Entity list.
