# Asset consuming O11 Business Process (BPT) elements

In ODC, business processes are available as [workflows](https://www.outsystems.com/tk/redirect?g=70b986e2-cd07-48a6-92c0-e57751112bb7), which have a different architecture and may still have yet limited support when compared to [O11 BPTs](../../building-apps/processes/intro.md).

## How to solve

<div class="info" markdown="1">

If you are only preparing your code for the conversion, at present, OutSystems recommends not making any changes to O11 BPTs. OutSystems is working on automating the conversion capabilities to map existing O11 BPTs functionality to ODC Workflows.

</div>

This pattern isn't supported yet.

You can only proceed with the conversion of ODC assets that donâ€™t consume [O11 BPT elements](#bpt-elements).

In the meantime, rethink how you can comply with the ODC architecture using [ODC workflows](https://www.outsystems.com/tk/redirect?g=70b986e2-cd07-48a6-92c0-e57751112bb7) to implement your business processes.
