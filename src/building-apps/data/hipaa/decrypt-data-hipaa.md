# Decrypting HIPAA compliant data

To enable the decryption of an entity's data, do the following:

![Flowchart illustrating the decryption process for HIPAA compliant data in OutSystems applications](images/decrypt-data-diag.png "Decryption Process Diagram")

1. Start by [creating a decryption action](#decrypt-action) that holds the decryption logic for the data of an entity.

1. Then for each attribute you need to decrypt, [add the logic to decrypt the data](#decrypt-attributes) depending on if it's saved as searchable or unsearchable.

## Create decryption action { #decrypt-action }

Start by creating an action that contains the logic to decrypt the attributes of an entity.

For each entity with attributes do decrypt, do the following:

1. In the module with the entity, add the following dependencies:

    * If you are decrypting unsearchable attributes, from the **Cryptography Services** producer, add the **DecryptEntityText** action.
    * If you are decrypting searchable attributes, from the **Cryptography Services** producer, add the **DecryptIndexText** action.

1. Create an action to handle the decryption. Create a **Server Action** or **Service Action**, and add the following parameters:

    * Add an **Input Parameter** named `Encrypted<entity>` with **&lt;entity&gt;** data type and set as **Mandatory**. &lt;entity&gt; is the entity with encrypted data.
    * Add an **Output Parameter** named `Decrypted<entity>` with **&lt;entity&gt;** data type.

After these steps, add the logic that allows the decryption of attributes. For each attribute follow [decrypt unsearchable attributes](#decrypt-no-search) or [decrypt searchable attributes](#decrypt-search)

## Decrypt attributes { #decrypt-attributes }

For each attribute you need to decrypt, add the logic to decrypt the data depending on if it's saved as [unsearchable](#decrypt-no-search) or [searchable](#decrypt-search).

Before adding the decryption for each attribute, ensure you have [created the decryption action for the entity](#decrypt-action).

### Decrypt unsearchable attributes { #decrypt-no-search }

Now add the logic to decrypt each of the unsearchable attributes, and then assign that decrypted data to an output.
For each encrypted unsearchable attribute, do the following:

1. In the decryption action, add an **Aggregate** with **KeyIds&lt;entity&gt;** Source, with the following **Filter**:

    * `KeyIds<entity>.<entity>Id` = `Encrypted<entity>.Id`
    * `KeyIds<entity>.Salt` = `<salt-for-attribute>`, replacing &lt;salt-for-attribute&gt; with the string that identifies the attribute used during encryption.

1. After the aggregate, add an **DecryptEntityText** action, and set it's inputs as follows:

    * Set **Encryptedtext** as `Encrypted<entity>.<attribute>`, where &lt;attribute&gt; is the unsearchable attribute.
    * Set **KeyId** as `GetKeyIdsBy<entity>Id.List.Current.KeyId`, where GetKeyIdsBy&lt;entity&gt;Id is the aggregate created on the previous step.
    * Set **EntityId** as `GetKeyIdsBy<entity>Id.List.Current.Salt`, where GetKeyIdsBy&lt;entity&gt;Id is the aggregate created on the previous step.

1. After **DecryptEntityText**, assign the decrypted text to the respective attribute of the output parameter. Add an **Assign** with the following assignment:

    * `Decrypted<entity>.<attribute>` = `DecryptEntityText.PlainText`

1. Publish the module.

### Decrypt searchable attributes { #decrypt-search }

Now add the logic to decrypt each of the searchable attributes, and then assign that decrypted data to an output.
For each encrypted searchable attribute, do the following:

1. In the decryption action, add a **GetIndexKey** action, and set it's **IndexType** to the string that identifies the attribute used during encryption.

1. After **GetIndexKey**, add a **DecryptIndexText** action, and set it's inputs as follows:

    * Set **Encryptedtext** as `Encrypted<entity>.<attribute>`, where &lt;attribute&gt; is the searchable attribute.
    * Set **KeyId** as the output of GetIndexKey, `GetIndexKey.KeyId`.

1. After **DecryptIndexText**, assign the decrypted text to the respective attribute of the output parameter. Add an **Assign** with the following assignment:

    * `Decrypted<entity>.<attribute>` = `DecryptIndexText.PlainText`

1. Publish the module.
