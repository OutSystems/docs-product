 # Mobile Plugins
 
-When developing a mobile app you often want to use the capabilities of the mobile device, such as the GPS or notifications. You can achieve this in OutSystems using plugins. A plugin is a module that acts as a wrapper for an Apache Cordova plugin and enables you to use native mobile features.
+Plugins provide crucial functionality to mobile apps, allowing developers to fully exploit the capabilities of mobile devices, offering users such features as notifications, camera functions, QC code readers, and global positioning services.
 
-You can find [ready-to-use plugins in Forge](<https://www.outsystems.com/forge/#category=plug-ins>), which contains both officially supported plugins and plugins created by the OutSystems Community. If you want to create your own plugins for use in mobile apps, do it by [wrapping an Apache Cordova plugin into a module](<using-cordova-plugins.md>).
+All mobile apps generated by OutSystems include a native shell with the following built-in plugins that are used internally, handling a variety of housekeeping and infrastructure tasks.
 
-## Using a mobile plugin
-
-[Install the plugin](<../../getting-started/component.md>) in the environment as any other component. Use the client actions of the plugin module to call the native capabilities of the device within your application. The plugin must support the mobile platforms (iOS, Android) for which you are creating an app or the app generation will fail.
-
-Each time you add, remove, or modify the plugin in an app, OutSystems [rebuilds the native shell](<../../deliver-mobile/mobile-app-update-scenarios.md#Situations_When_the_User_Must_Install_a_New_Build>) which you then have to distribute to the end users for installation.
-
-You must [include the plugin license](<../../deliver-mobile/compliance-with-third-party-licenses.md#Include_the_Third_Party_Licenses_Used_by_Plug-ins_or_Components>) in your app to respect the license agreements of that plugin. These license agreements are usually placed in the About page of the app that uses them.
+Plugin | Description
+-------|-----------------
+OS Cache       | Allows your application to run offline or with bad network conditions.
+OS Cordova Loader | Loads the Cordova engine on your app.
+OS Deeplinks   | Allows opening hyperlinks to specific screens of your app.
+OS DB Upgrader | Manages the local storage of your app.
+OS Manifest    | Provides a parser for the app manifest.
+OS Pre-Bundle  | Handles the content of pre-bundled resources on your app.
+OS Security    | Provides the required APIs for the security layer.
+NetworkStatus  | Allows your application to know when the device is online/offline and the type of network available (for example, WiFi, 3G, 4G).
+Mobile AppFeedback | Enables the user to invoke App Feedback for submitting feedback about the app.
 
-## What are the supported plugins provided by OutSystems { #Supported_Plugins }
+ While you may see the names of these built-in plugins in the [native mobile shell logs](<../../managing-the-applications-lifecycle/monitor-and-troubleshoot/monitoring-an-environment.md>) they are not user-configurable. The only exception is [Mobile AppFeedback](<../../managing-the-applications-lifecycle/app-feedback/user-feedback-enable.md>), which is present in the native shell if the App Feedback feature is enabled.

+## Using a mobile plugin
 
-This is the list of officially supported mobile plugins. Some of these plugins are already supported when distributing your app as a Progressive Web App (PWA).

-## Built-in plugins
+## Additional mobile plugin resources
