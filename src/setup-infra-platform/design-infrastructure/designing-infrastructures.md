**Important:** The information in this guide applies only to OutSystems Platform on-premises or private cloud deployments.

A well designed infrastructure for the OutSystems Platform prevents typical project shortcomings. These will impact productivity and development further down the road.

The plan involves configuring your servers for scaling, high availability, disaster recovery and security.

Check [OutSystems Platform system requirements](https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/11/Setting_Up_OutSystems/OutSystems_system_requirements) for detailed information on supported configurations.
