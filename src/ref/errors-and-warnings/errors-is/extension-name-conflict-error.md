# Extension Name Conflict Error

Message
:   `Extension Name <name> already exists. Please rename it in Integration Studio before trying to store or publish it again.`

Cause
:   There is another extension with the same name in the Platform Server you are connected to.

Recommendation
:   You must change the [extension name](<../../integration-studio/element-property/extension.md>).
