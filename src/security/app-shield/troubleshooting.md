# Troubleshooting AppShield crashes

<div class="info" markdown="1">

Applies only to Mobile Apps.

</div>

## Crash logs

When AppShield detects a security threat to the app, it either blocks it or, in some scenarios, immediately **crashes the app** to close all windows at malicious attempts.

### Android

When a crash occurs on **Android**, the device log should contain an entry that can help identify the reason of the crash.
These crash logs are usually in the following format:

``` 
--------- beginning of crash
E  FATAL EXCEPTION: 
Process: com.outsystems.myapp, PID: 25983
i.aw: 1a
	at i.ap.b(Unknown Source:69)
	at i.ap.a(Unknown Source:0)
```

In the scenario, the line `i.aw: 1a` includes the reason for the crash which has the code `1a` - `Developer Options enabled on device`.
The first part of the line varies from app to app, and the reason code is next to the colon (:).

### iOS

On iOS, it isn't possible to have such logs. Thus, the best way to troubleshoot the reason for an app crash from AppShield protection features is to implement the **[ExitOnURL](./ExitOnUrl.md)** configuration to inform the user of the reason. The **ExitOnURL** lets you define an **Exit URL** which the app opens in the default browser. It also lets you explain the issue to the app users.

## Shutdown reasons

Although unclear, these logs contain an Hexadecimal value which is the `Reason` for the exit to happen. Here's a list of codes for the `Reason`:
