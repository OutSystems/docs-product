OutSystems allows you to customize the URL of your REST API methods according to your needs.  
For example, you could customize this URL:

`GET https://<server>/PhoneAPI/rest/v1/GetContact?Id={Id}`  

to the following one:

`GET https://<server>/PhoneAPI/rest/v1/Contacts/{Id}`

For that, do the following:

1. In the **Logic** tab, open the **Integrations** folder.
1. Expand the REST API and select the method you want to change to display its properties.
1. Set the "URL Path" property of the REST API method to the new custom URL.

    Example: `/Contacts/{Id}`

    Note: You must set any input parameters included in the URL as mandatory.

The URL property changes accordingly.

The following sections show some examples of how to customize your endpoints.

## Endpoints for collections example

Use the same name for methods related to a resource. OutSystems knows which method to execute through the HTTP verb (for example, `GET` or `POST`):

Default Endpoint | URL Path | Customized Endpoint
---|---|---
`GET /PhoneAPI/rest/v1/GetContacts` | `/Contacts` | `GET /PhoneAPI/rest/v1/Contacts`
`POST /PhoneAPI/rest/v1/CreateContact` | `/Contacts`  | `POST /PhoneAPI/rest/v1/Contacts`
  
_Note:_ Endpoints displayed without protocol and server information for brevity.

## Endpoints for a resource example

When handling a specific resource, start the "URL Path" property value with the collection name and then add one of the following, depending on the HTTP verb:

* For `GET` or `DELETE`: Add the resource identifier (the input parameter of the REST API method) between `{` and `}`.
* For `PUT`: Add nothing, since the resource is already passed in the request Header or Body.

Default Endpoint | URL Path | Customized Endpoint
---|---|---
`GET /PhoneAPI/rest/v1/GetContact` | `/Contacts/{Id}`  | `GET /PhoneAPI/rest/v1/Contacts/{Id}`
`DELETE /PhoneAPI/rest/v1/DeleteContact` | `/Contacts/{Id}` | `DELETE /PhoneAPI/restv1/Contacts/{Id}`
`PUT /PhoneAPI/rest/v1/UpdateContact` | `/Contacts` | `PUT /PhoneAPI/rest/v1/Contacts`

## Endpoints for sub-collections example

With master-detail relationships, handle details as a collection under the master resource:

Default Endpoint  |  URL Path  |  Customized Endpoint  
---|---|---  
`GET /PhoneAPI/rest/v1/GetContactAddresses` | `/Contacts/{Id}/Addresses` | `GET /PhoneAPI/rest/v1/Contacts/{Id}/Addresses`

## Final remarks

* You can't use the reserved characters "?" and "=" in custom REST URLs of exposed REST API methods.  
    These characters belong in the query string part of URLs (the part of the URL that starts with a "?" character), and the platform manages the query string part of URLs in exposed REST URL methods.

* When calling an exposed REST API method you must provide any input parameters with the "Receive In" property set to "URL" that aren't included in the custom URL as part of the query string.

    For example, as a follow-up to the examples presented in the previous section, consider an exposed REST API method "GetContactAddress" with two input parameters, "Id" and "AddressId".

    You can set the custom URL of this method to `/Contacts/{Id}/Addresses/{AddressId}`. In this case, all input parameters defined as received in the URL are present in the "URL Path" value. To call this method with `Id=5` (the contact ID) and `AddressId=10` you would use the following URL:

    `GET /PhoneAPI/rest/v1/Contacts/5/Addresses/10`

    You could also set the custom URL to `/Contacts/{Id}/Addresses`, without including the "AddressId" input parameter in the custom URL. In this case, to call the method including a value for the "AddressId" you would include this parameter at the end of the URL as part of the query string:

    `GET /PhoneAPI/rest/v1/Contacts/5/Addresses?AddressId=10`
