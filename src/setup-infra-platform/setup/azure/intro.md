# OutSystems on Microsoft Azure

OutSystems solution template for Microsoft Azure Marketplace provides you with an OutSystems 11 infrastructure with four environments: Development, Test, Production, and [LifeTime deployment management console](../../../manage-platform-app-lifecycle/intro.md). At the end of the [setup process](set-up-platform.md "Set Up OutSystems on Microsoft Azure"), you will have an OutSystems infrastructure running on Azure configured according to OutSystems best practices.

## OutSystems Infrastructure

The deployed OutSystems infrastructure is summarized in the following diagram:

Learn [more details about the deployed infrastructure](quick-reference.md "Quick Reference for OutSystems on Microsoft Azure") in the quick reference.

## Farm Option for Production Environment

You can choose to deploy a Farm production environment with the front-end server running on a scale set. The incoming application traffic will be sent to this node while the Deployment Controller will be an independent VM outside the HTTP(S) workload.

Alternatively, you can deploy a standalone production environment with a single server playing the roles of both front-end server (FE) and OutSystems Deployment Controller service (DC).

## Horizontal Scaling

Production environments, when deployed in Farm mode, are ready for horizontal scaling with [Azure scale sets](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/overview "About the virtual machine scale sets"). This scaling operation is exclusively done in the Azure Portal, so you donâ€™t have to make any changes in OutSystems to register the new front-end servers. This will allow your Farm to distribute the workload evenly across the scale set servers.
