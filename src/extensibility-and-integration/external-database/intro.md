# Integrate with an External Database

OutSystems integrates with your existing databases. This allows you to develop applications that access data on external databases using OutSystems entities in Service Studio and without having to worry about data migration. For a list of supported external database engines and their supported versions check the System Requirements.

You can integrate with an external database in the following ways:

[Integrate with an external database using Integration Studio](connect-external-db.md)
