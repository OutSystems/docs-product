Message
:   `This server is consuming more resources than allowed by its license. Either the license contract should be changed or the features usage decreased`

Cause
:   The server you're using has exceeded the licensed limit of one or more features. If the license contract is not changed to increase the allowed features usage or if current features usage does not decrease, you won't be able to use any of the licensed features for this server.

Recommendation
:   Check with your Service Center administrator which feature(s) exceeded their licensed usage limit. This may help you to do your share in cleaning up old or obsolete information like users or modules. Otherwise, ask him/her to change the license contract.

Message
:   `You should not publish more modules because you reached the limit of <number> Software Units that this server license allows`

Cause
:   You are trying to publish a module and the Platform Server you're using has exceeded its licensed limit of Software Units. If the license contract is not changed to increase the allowed software units usage or if its current usage does not decrease, you won't be able to publish anymore modules.

Recommendation
:   Clean up old or obsolete modules or contact your Service Center administrator to change the license contract.
