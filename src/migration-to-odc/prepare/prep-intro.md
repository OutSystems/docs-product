# Prepare O11 app

<div class="info" markdown="1">

This article only applies to customers with access to the Migration Kit.

The preparation stage is a period of refactoring your O11 apps so that they're ready for migration to the ODC platform. This document is intended for O11 application architects who are planning and preparing the existing O11 application architecture to enable smooth migration to ODC in the future.

As you plan and prepare your existing O11 app architecture to migrate smoothly to ODC, you must refactor and adjust your O11 code and architecture in Service Studio to facilitate the migration process.

## Prerequisites

Before your refactor your O11 apps to be ODC-compatible, ensure you have:

* Designed the ODC to be architecture
* Mapped O11 apps to ODC asset.
* Identified any architectural inconsistencies in the O11 app and adjusted the architecture based on the findings.

## Prepare O11 app migration

Hereâ€™s the high-level process on how you can prepare your O11 app to be  ODC-compatible:

1. [Adapt O11 apps to make them compatible with ODC](prep-refactor-o11-apps.md)

1. Deploy O11 apps to QA

1. Test O11 apps

## Additional resources

Here's some additional resources and training materials that can help you understand ODC architecture better:
