# Month Picker

You can use the Month Picker UI Pattern to allow users input a month of the year. The Month Picker Pattern is based on the [flatpickr library](https://flatpickr.js.org/) For more advanced options, you can refer to this library.

## How to use the Month Picker UI Pattern

1. In Service Studio, in the Toolbox, search for `Month Picker`.
    
    The Month Picker widget is displayed.

    ![Screenshot of the Month Picker widget in the Service Studio toolbox](images/monthpicker-widget-ss.png "Month Picker Widget in Service Studio")

    If the UI widget doesn't display, it's because the dependency isn't added. This happens because the Remove unused references setting is enabled. To make the widget available in your app:

    1. In the Toolbox, click **Search in other modules**.

    1. In **Search in other Modules**, remove any spaces between words in your search text.
    
    1. Select the widget you want to add from the **OutSystemsUI** module, and click **Add Dependency**. 

    1. In the Toolbox, search for the widget again.

1. From the Toolbox, drag the Month Picker widget into the Main Content area of your application's screen.

    ![Dragging the Month Picker widget into the Main Content area of an application's screen](images/monthpicker-dragwidget-ss.png "Dragging Month Picker Widget to Screen")

    By default, the Month Picker contains an **Input** widget (type Text).

1. Create a local variable by selecting the Input widget, and, on the **Properties** tab, select **New Local Variable** from the **Variable** dropdown.

    This variable stores any value entered into or received by the input widget.

1. Enter a name for the variable (in this example **MonthVar**) and select **Text** as the **Data Type**.

    ![Naming the local variable as 'MonthVar' and selecting 'Text' as the data type](images/monthpicker-monthvar-ss.png "Naming the Month Variable")

1. Right-click your main screen and add another local variable.

    This variable stores the month selected by the user.

1. Enter a name for the variable (in this example **MonthPicked**) and select **MonthYear** as the **Data Type**.

1. To create an **OnSelect** event for the Month Picker, select the Month Picker widget, and on the **Properties** tab, from the **Handler** dropdown, select **New Client Action**.

1. To access the month selected by the user, create an **Assign** and set the **MonthPicked** to **SelectedMonth**.

    ![Adding an Assign to set the 'MonthPicked' variable to 'SelectedMonth' in the client action](images/monthpicker-assign-ss.png "Adding an Assign to Client Action")

1. You can configure the Month Picker by selecting the pattern, and on the **Properties** tab, set the relevant (optional) properties.

After following these steps and publishing the module, you can test the pattern in your app.
