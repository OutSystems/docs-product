# Implementing a WAF for your applications on OutSystems Cloud

Following the initial deployment of your cloud infrastructure and the development of your first application, the next critical step should be to enhance the security of your applications. 
For each OutSystems Cloud environment an Application Load Balancer with WAF capabilities exists to protect your applications from a wide range of attack types. Our OutSystems Cloud team is committed to reviewing and managing some of these protections and thrive to keep them updated to the latest security threats.

On top of this out of the box protection, you can have your own WAF to enhance the security of your applications with tailored WAF rules for your applications needs.

The WAF that you implement on your side will grant you extra security such as the ability to disallow certain geo locations to access your applications, implementing additional custom WAF rules to protect from certain attacks more common to your applications’ use case, and additional security monitoring and alerting.
On top of this, some WAF providers such as Cloudflare and Akamai also come with a CDN feature that will bring a significant impact on the performance of your applications and offload some requests from coming to your OutSystems Cloud Application Servers.
There are no special requirements from OutSystems side to run a WAF in your OutSystems Cloud.

## Recommended WAF rules

Web Application Firewalls (WAF) have a set of rules that you can configure, in the following table you can see the recommended WAF rules that you should always apply to your WAF when using it on your OutSystems applications

## Post WAF configuration activities

After installing your WAF and configuring it to point to the OutSystems Cloud Servers, there are a few measures you can take to further enhance your security configuration. Here are a few key recommendations:

* **Explore and Experiment.** Fully use the capabilities of your WAF by exploring and experimenting with different rules and settings. This helps to strengthen the security of your applications and safeguard your users.
* **Rule Customization.** Customize the security rules to address specific threats relevant to your applications. Regularly update and refine these rules based on evolving security needs and emerging threats.
* **Monitor Security Analytics.** Both Cloudflare and Akamai, and likely other WAF providers offer a Security Analytics feature that allows you to keep monitoring incoming traffic and if they deem it as malicious. With that information you can created additional rules to keep your applications more protected
* **Involve an expert.** Many WAF providers have security experts that your team can rely to help you tailor your security configurations better to your applications’ use cases.
