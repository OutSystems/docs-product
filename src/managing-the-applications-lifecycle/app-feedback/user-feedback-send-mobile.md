# Send feedback in mobile apps

Users can send feedback from mobile apps by long-pressing two fingers. [View the user feedback](user-feedback-handle.md) in the App Feedback app. Note that you first need to [activate the feedback feature in the environment](user-feedback-enable.md).

Users can send feedback as voice recordings as well, which requires a permission to access the microphone. When sending the first feedback, the app asks for the microphone access:
