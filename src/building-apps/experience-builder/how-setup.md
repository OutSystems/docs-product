# How to set up Experience Builder

Learn how to set up Experience Builder.

## Prerequisites

To use Experience Builder, make sure the following prerequisites are met.

### Your environment

To set up and use Experience Builder your environment must comply with the following prerequisites:

* Your environment is associated with an [OutSystems Edition](https://www.outsystems.com/pricing-and-editions/) that isn't the Free Edition. **You can't use a Personal Environment with Experience Builder**.

* Your development environment uses [Platform Server release 11.7.2](https://www.outsystems.com/Downloads/ScreenDetails.aspx?MajorVersion=11&ReleaseId=19414&ComponentName=Platform+Server) or later.

* Your development environment allows communication with Experience Builder by allowing inbound traffic from `https://experiencebuilder.outsystems.com` in **port 443**. The Experience Builder will use the environment's public DNS hostname to communicate. Check [Experience Builder network requirements](../../setup-infra-platform/setup/network-requirements.md#experience-builder) for detailed information.

    If your infrastructure is on OutSystems Cloud and you didn't [configure an internal network for the environment](../../security/configure-internal-network.md), you already fulfill this prerequisite.

    </div>

* Your development environment has [Outsystems UI](https://www.outsystems.com/forge/component-overview/1385/outsystems-ui) 2.5.2 or later.

### Your user

You must have an IT user with **Change and Deploy Application** and **Create Applications** permissions for the environment.

### Your device

You can access Experience Builder with the **latest versions** of the following **desktop browsers**:

* Edge.
* Firefox.
* Google Chrome.
* Safari.

## Log in for the first time

When you log in to [Experience Builder](https://experiencebuilder.outsystems.com/) for the first time you enter the following welcome screen:

To log in to Experience Builder, perform the following steps.

    Use a **non-production environment** with Experience Builder, preferably your **development environment**.  
    When you publish an app in Experience Builder, the app is published in the environment you entered in the log in.

As a first user from your organization logging in, you first need to register your environment. The registration procedures vary, depending on the Platform Version installed in the environment.

To begin registering your infrastructure in Experience Builder, perform the following steps:

1. Click on the **Register Environment** button.
