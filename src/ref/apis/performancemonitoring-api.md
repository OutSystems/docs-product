# PerformanceMonitoring API

To allow you to analyze the user experience of your applications, OutSystems logs [request events](#requestevent) with valuable data for your analytics. To give you access to request events, the PerformanceMonitoring API provides REST API methods to:

* retrieve a list of request events that occurred in your application
* register your own request related events

The server only stores data for the last two days. Learn [how application performance is measured](../../managing-the-applications-lifecycle/monitor-and-troubleshoot/how-application-performance-is-measured.md).

## Summary

Methods | Description 
---|---  
[GET RequestEvents](#get-requestevents) | Returns a list of request events, filtered by the event names and time interval you specify in the parameters.  
[POST RequestEvents](#post-requestevents) | Logs a request event. Based on that data you can analyze the user experience of your applications.  
  
Resources | Description
---|---  
[RequestEvent](#requestevent) | Represents an event of a web request, sent to an OutSystems application.  
  
## Methods

### GET RequestEvents

Returns a list of request events, filtered by event names and time interval you specify in the parameters.

This method requires basic authentication. You need to provide the credentials of a LifeTime user. It returns request events only for those applications to which the user has 'Reuse & Monitor' permission in the environment. Learn more about how to [configure security for an infrastructure](../../managing-the-applications-lifecycle/manage-it-teams/intro.md).

To use it in an application, make sure that [monitoring is turned on](../../managing-the-applications-lifecycle/monitor-and-troubleshoot/enable-analytics-for-an-environment.md) for the environment, and for the application module. Otherwise the API responds with a status code of '200 - OK', but doesn't retrieve any events.

#### URL

`http://[server]/PerformanceProbe/rest/PerformanceMonitoringAPI/RequestEvents/?EventNames={EventNames}&StartInstant={StartInstant}&EndInstant={EndInstant}&NumberOfResults={NumberOfResults}`

#### Input

EventNames
:   Type: string, optional, to be sent in the URL.  
    List of events to filter on. Separate event names with a comma.  
    Example: "WebScreenClientExecuted,WebScreenServerExecuted".

StartInstant
:   Type: date time, mandatory, to be sent in the URL.  
    The start date and time of the time interval you want to filter on. Format: ISO 8601.  
    Example: "2012-04-23T18:25:43.511Z".

EndInstant
:   Type: date time, mandatory, to be sent in the URL.  
    The end date and time of the time period you want to filter on. Format: ISO 8601.  
    Example: "2012-04-23T18:25:43.511Z".

NumberOfResults
:   Type: int32, optional, to be sent in the URL.  
    The maximum number of events to return. Note that the actual upper limit never exceeds the default limit (15000).  
    This limit is set in the 'MaxResponseSize' site property of the PerformanceProbe module of your environment.

#### Output

RequestEventList
:   Type: list of RequestEvent.  
    List of RequestEvent objects filtered on.

ResultsTruncated
:   Type: boolean.  
    Indicates if not all the results were returned, due to the limit of objects in the list.  
    This can occur due to the limit set either in the 'NumberOfResults' parameter, or in the 'MaxResponseSize' site property of the PerformanceProbe module of your environment. Default limit: 15000.  
    To retrieve the next set of results, you can send a new GET request. Set its StartInstant parameter to the Instant of the most recent RequestEvent you got on the previous request.

#### Example Request

```
curl --user mike.fitt:123456 
"http://outsystemscloud.com/PerformanceProbe/rest/PerformanceMonitoringAPI/RequestEvents/?StartInstant=2015-09-28T12:45:00.000Z&EndInstant=2015-09-28T12:47:00.025Z"

### POST RequestEvents

Adds an event to the request event logs, allowing you to collect custom data about web requests. This method uses the [LogRequestEvent](auto/asynchronous-logging-api.final.md) method of the AsynchronousLogging API, which relies on a non-persistent message queue. As a result, request events that are in the message queue waiting to be processed are lost in the case of a system failure.

To use this method in an application, make sure that [monitoring is turned on](../../managing-the-applications-lifecycle/monitor-and-troubleshoot/enable-analytics-for-an-environment.md) for the environment, and for the application module. Otherwise the API responds with a status code of '200 â€“ OK', but doesn't register the event.

#### URL

`http://<server>/PerformanceProbe/rest/PerformanceMonitoringAPI/RequestEvents/`

#### Input

RequestEvent
:   Type: RequestEvent, mandatory, to be sent in the request body (JSON).  
    The event of a request in an application to be logged.
