# On Application Ready

<div class="info" markdown="1">

Applies to Mobile Apps and Reactive Web Apps only

</div>

Your app runs the **On Application Ready** during the loading of the home module. Use **On Application Ready** to set up the app, for example, to initialize variables and mobile plugins.

Up to Platform Server version 11.16.0, the **On Application Ready** action runs asynchronously, and doesn't block the render of the screens.
On Platform Server version 11.16.1 and higher, the **On Application Ready** action runs synchronously and blocks screen render.

Note that **On Application Ready** by design runs only during the loading of the home module. This means that the app ignores this action in the non-home modules.

To add the **On Application Ready** action to a Mobile or Reactive Web App do the following in Service Studio:

1. In the home module of your app, open the **Logic** tab.

1. Right-click the **Client Actions** node in the tree and select **Add System Event** > **On Application Ready**.
