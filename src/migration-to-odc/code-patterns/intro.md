# O11 to ODC conversion patterns

This page describes the app patterns you need to consider to ensure a smooth conversion of your O11 apps to ODC.

<div class="info" markdown="1">

OutSystems is working on conversion automation capabilities to support some of these patterns. Until then, you can use this information to help you [plan your conversion](../migration-intro.md#stage-1-plan-for-the-o11-app-migration).

If you have access to the App Conversion Kit, the Conversion Assessment Tool identifies some of the code patterns that you need to handle to achieve a successful conversion of your apps.

</div>

You must handle different patterns during the several conversion phases:

* [Before the conversion](#handle-o11), you must prepare your O11 apps to be ODC compatible and ready to convert.  

* [After the conversion](#handle-odc), you must make some adjustments to ensure your new ODC apps can be published.

## Patterns to handle in O11 { #handle-o11 }

These are the patterns that require changes in the O11 apps before proceeding with the conversion to ODC.

### Code

* [Application consuming a non-read only Entity](arch-non-read-only-entity.md)
* [Asset consuming a Local Storage Entity](arch-local-storage.md)
* [Asset consuming a private Structure](arch-priv-struct.md)
* [Asset consuming a Process](arch-process.md)
* [Asset consuming a Resource](arch-resource.md)
* [Asset consuming a Script](arch-script.md)
* [Asset consuming an Application Theme](arch-app-theme.md)
* [Asset consuming an Image from an Application](arch-image.md)
* [Asset consuming an ODC application Block](arch-block.md)
* [Asset consuming an ODC application Client Action](arch-client-action.md)
* [Asset consuming an ODC application Server Action](arch-server-action.md)
* [Asset consuming a reference to the Common Plugin](arch-common-plugin.md)
* [Library with cyclic dependency to another ODC library](arch-lib-cyclic.md)
* [Asset consuming a Traditional Web module](convert-trad-web.md) - Optionally, you can choose to solve this pattern in ODC after the conversion.
* [Asset consuming a Forge component](arch-forge.md) - Optionally, you can choose to solve this pattern in ODC after the conversion.
* [Asset consuming an O11 app that is not mapped to any ODC asset](arch-not-mapped.md) - Optionally, you can choose to solve this pattern in ODC after the conversion.
* [Asset consuming its own service action](arch-internal-service-action.md) - Optionally, you can choose to solve this pattern in ODC after the conversion.
* [Asset cannot contain Traditional Web modules](elem-trad-web.md)
* [Refactor anonymous and registered roles](refactor-anonymous-registered-roles.md)

### Data { #data-patterns }

* [Large binaries validation](data-large-binaries-validation.md)
* [User email validation](data-user-email-validation.md)

### App configuration

* [Align persistent login timeout](persistent-login-timeout.md)

## Patterns to handle in ODC { #handle-odc }

These are the patterns that require changes in the converted ODC apps before you publish them.

### Code

* [Asset consuming O11 platform system elements](arch-system-element.md)
* [Asset consuming O11 user management elements](arch-user-mng-elements.md)
* [Asset consuming an extension](arch-extension.md)
* [Asset using unsupported O11 built-in function](elem-built-in-function.md)
* [Application with SQL Node](elem-sql-adapt.md)
* [Asset contains REST APIs using built-in OAuth 2.0 authentication flow](elem-rest-oauth2.md)
* [Asset with SAP BAPI connection](elem-sap.md)
* [Adapt login and logout flow of converted apps](execute-adapt-login-flow.md)
* [Aggregate or SQL node referenced outside its scope](aggregate-sql-scope.md)

### App configuration

* [Refactor site properties to be ODC-compatible](refactor-siteproperties.md)
* [Update the URLs of consumed REST API endpoints](update-url-consumed-rest-endpoint.md)

## Limitations

Conversion to ODC isn't yet supported for the following patterns.

### Code

* [SOAP](elem-soap.md)
* [Apps containing BPT elements](elem-bpt.md) or [consuming BPT elements](arch-bpt-elements.md)
* [Modules having a user provider different than Users](elem-user-provider.md)
* [Multi-tenant modules](elem-multi-tenant.md)


### Infrastructure

* [Self-managed infrastructures](infra-self-managed.md)
* [Additional pipelines](infra-additional-pipelines.md)
