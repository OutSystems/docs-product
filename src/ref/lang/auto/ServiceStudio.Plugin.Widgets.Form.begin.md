Groups a set of input widgets sharing the same validation context. A common usage for this widget is to group the several inputs of an Entity or Structure record in a screen to create or update that record.

The layout of this widget is flexible, allowing you to organize the widgets inside the way you need.

All enabled inputs inside the form will have the following behaviors:

* When the mouse hovers over the input, an icon appears inside the input indicating that the value is editable.
* After changing a value in one input, an undo action becomes available allowing the end-user to revert the value to the original one.
