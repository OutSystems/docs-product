# Import Flow Templates

OutSystems Experience Builder allows you to create mobile applications based on pre-built flow templates. These flows are a great accelerator for your application development, however, it is impossible to cover all existing use cases. By importing **your own** flows, Experience Builder's capabilities are extended, thus enabling limitless possibilities that fit every specific use case.

Through the process of importing flows into Experience Builder, OutSystems team leaders and developers can create their own flows. The flows can be built from scratch or existing ones can be adapted so that they are available to all users in the factory. By combining imported flows with Experience Builder flows, users can quickly create the ideal mobile app for the end-user.
