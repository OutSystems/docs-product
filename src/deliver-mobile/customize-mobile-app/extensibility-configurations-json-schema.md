# Extensibility Configurations JSON Schema

The **Extensibility Configurations** field provides additional settings as a JSON string. A number of settings you can change in the user interface of the IDE (for example, the name of the app). Some advanced settings are available in the **Extensibility Configurations** only (for example, adding custom mobile plugins). You can edit **Extensibility Configurations** in the properties of your home module.

## Property schema

The value of the **Extensibility Configurations** property of a mobile app module is a JSON object. What follows is the JSON schema outlining the most common options. There may be other options applicable in your use case, if the feature you're using provides them.

## Preferences

The following section provides more details about the options you can use in the `preferences` top-level property. For a comprehensive list of the available settings, see [preferences in Config.xml](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/dev/config_ref/index.html#preference) by Apache Cordova. 

| Property                          | Platform | Default | Description |
| --------------------------------- | -------- | ------- | ----------- |
| (iOS_FEATURE)UsageDescription    | iOS        | NA       | Adds preferences that match the pattern of UsageDescription to the Info.plist file. For full list, see [Cocoa Keys](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CocoaKeys.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009251-SW1) and filter by UsageDescription. For an example, see information about [iOS usage descriptions](https://success.outsystems.com/Support/Release_Notes/Mobile_Apps_Build_Service/MABS_Version_7.1#iOS_Usage_Descriptions) in the release notes. |
| AddUploadWidgetPermissions      | Android, iOS        | true       | Set as false to skip adding permissions required by the upload widget to AndroidManifest.xml and/or Info.plist. For an example, see information about [Upload widget permissions](https://success.outsystems.com/Support/Release_Notes/Mobile_Apps_Build_Service/MABS_Version_7.1#Upload_Widget_Permissions) in the release notes. |
| EnableRefererHeaderCustomScheme | iOS        | false       | Set to true to inject the `Referer: URL` in the requests of the native app, where `URL` is the app domain.         |
| InitLoggerSyncDelay             | Android        | 0       | Seconds to delay the logger synchronization after the initialization.         |
| RemoveUserCertificates          | Android        | false       | Set to true to remove user certificates from the trust anchors in network_security_config.xml.         |
| FilterTouchesWhenObscured | Android | false | Defines the value of the filterTouchesWhenObscured property of WebView on Android. Set to true to prevent the app from handling touches while obscured by other apps. Learn more about filterTouchesWhenObscured [here](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View#security).|

## Constraints

To ensure the platform can build your app successfully and that your app works correctly, keep in mind the following restraints for the **Extensibility Configurations** JSON.

### Generic

Generic constants, applicable to all parts of the **Extensibility Configurations** JSON.

* The JSON schema and key/value pairs must follow the structure as described in this topic. 
* The first-level key/value pairs are optional and the order isn't relevant. 
* Write the name of each name/value pair using lower case letters, as the JSON is case sensitive. 

### Resources

Constraints related to managing the app resources in the **Extensibility Configurations** JSON.

* You can specify only one resource key in the JSON. All content used in the app must be inside that file (icons, splash screens, and plugins). 
* When specifying the resource file for the app, the resource name must end with ".zip". 
* The resource file name must be equal to the resource name of the file you add. 
* The specified path for an asset (for example, the icon or splash screen) in the JSON must be the same as the path inside the resources ZIP file.

## Additional information

Additional information about the **Extensibility Configurations**.

* For information about **progressive web app (PWA) manifest**, see [Advanced PWA settings and customization](../distribute-pwa/advanced.md).
* You can **override** the JSON from Service Studio with a JSON in LifeTime. See [Override the default mobile Extensibility Configurations](../../managing-the-applications-lifecycle/deploy-applications/override-extensibility-configurations.md) for more information.
* If you're using AppShield to **harden your mobile app** and protect it from tampering, see the [AppShield plugin configuration](../app-shield/intro.md#configuration).
