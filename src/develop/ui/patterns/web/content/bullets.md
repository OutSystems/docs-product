# Bullets

You can use the Bullets UI Pattern to organize topics into separate bullet points.

**How to use the Bullets UI Pattern**

1. In Service Studio, in the Toolbox, search for `Bullets`.

    The Bullets widget is displayed.

    ![](<images/bullets-1-ss.png>)

    If the UI widget doesn't display, it's because the dependency isn't added. For example, if you are using a ready-made app, it deletes unused widgets from the module. To make the widget available in your app:

    1. In the Toolbox, click **Search in other modules**.

    1. In **Search in other Modules**, remove any spaces between words in your search text.
    
    1. Select the widget you want to add from the **OutSystemsUIWeb** module, and click **Add Dependency**. 
    
    1. In the Toolbox, search for the widget again.

1. From the Toolbox, drag the Bullets widget into the Main Content area of your application's screen.

    ![](<images/bullets-2-ss.png>)

    By default, the Bullets widget contains 3 Bullet Items. You can add or delete Bullet Items as required. To create sub-bullets, you can drag the Bullets widget into the Bullet Item placeholder.

1. Add your content to the placeholders. In this example we add text to each of the placeholders. 

    **Note**: If you leave any placeholder blank, it will not be displayed when the page is rendered.

    ![](<images/bullets-5-ss.png>)

After following these steps and publishing the module, you can test the pattern in your app. 

## Properties
