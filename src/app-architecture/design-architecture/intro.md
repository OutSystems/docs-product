# Designing the Architecture of Your OutSystems Applications

This guide builds upon the [Architecture Canvas](01-4-layer-canvas.md) methodology to help you through what you must consider to develop your applications with a future-proof architecture from the start.

It presents [validation rules](03-validating-app-architecture.md) to make sure your architecture has been correctly designed, a generic [Service-Oriented Architecture](04-soa-architectures.md), a Microservices-style implementation and different [architectural patterns](05-integration-patterns.md) that reflect best practices in OutSystems application design.
