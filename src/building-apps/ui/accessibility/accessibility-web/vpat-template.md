# VPAT - Voluntary Product Accessibility Template

<div class="info" markdown="1">

Applies only to Traditional Web Apps

</div>

The purpose of the Voluntary Product Accessibility Template, or VPAT™, is to assist Federal contracting officials and other buyers. It helps them make preliminary assessments regarding the support given by OutSystems. This support relates to the delivery of accessibility standards-compliant applications.

## Summary Table - Supporting Features

The scope of this VPAT includes the ability to create applications that are Section 508 compliant using OutSystems technology. This applies to the custom applications delivered by OutSystems customers and developers, not to the development toolset (for example, the visual integrated development environment).

Since a specific OutSystems customer ultimately designs, develops, and delivers every application, this VPAT notes all applicable standards as Supports. This means that as a development platform, OutSystems fully meets the letter and intent of criteria. The developer is responsible for using the required constructs, configurations, and design patterns of their choice while adhering to accessibility compliance requirements.

## Section 1194.22 Web-based Internet Information and Applications 

The VPAT Board interprets paragraphs (a) through (k) of this section as consistent with the following priority 1 Checkpoints of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 (WCAG 1.0) published by the Web Accessibility Initiative of the World Wide Web Consortium.

OutSystems publishes a set of facilitators and guidelines that, even though not exhaustive or prescriptive, help OutSystems developers to understand how they can use OutSystems’s capabilities to deliver WCAG compliant applications.
