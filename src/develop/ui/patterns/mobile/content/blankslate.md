# Blank Slate

You can use the Blank State UI Pattern to inform end users, for example, to complete a task or when there is no data available for display etc.

**How to use the Blank Slate UI Pattern**

1. In Service Studio, in the Toolbox, search for `Blank Slate`.

    The Blank Slate widget is displayed.

    ![](<images/blankslate-2-ss.png>)

    If the UI widget doesn't display, it's because the dependency isn't added. For example, if you are using a ready-made app, it deletes unused widgets from the module. To make the widget available in your app:

    1. In the Toolbox, click **Search in other modules**.

    1. In **Search in other Modules**, remove any spaces between words in your search text.
    
    1. Select the widget you want to add from the **OutSystemsUI** module, and click **Add Dependency**. 
    
    1. In the Toolbox, search for the widget again.

1. From the Toolbox, drag the Blank Slate widget into the Main Content area of your application's screen.

    ![](<images/blankslate-3-ss.png?width=800>)

    By default, the Blank Slate widget contains icon, content, and action placeholders.

1. Add your content to the placeholders.

    In this example, we change the icon to a calendar icon, enter some text in the Content placeholder, and add a button to the Actions placeholder. This button, when clicked, redirects the user to another page.

After following these steps and publishing the module, you can test the pattern in your app.
