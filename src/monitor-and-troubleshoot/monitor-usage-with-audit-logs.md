# Monitor Usage with Audit Logs

OutSystems logs every task performed by IT users in the infrastructure management, and keeps an audit log made available to consult. This ensures you have traceability in your infrastructure, and can follow up when problems arise, since no interaction goes unnoticed.

IT users have access to the audit log and can check:

* The tasks IT users performed
* All tasks performed to:
    * Applications
    * Deployment Plans
    * Users
    * Teams
    * Roles
    * Environments
    * Infrastructure

## See the Tasks a User has Performed

You can find the audit log for the tasks a user has made in the user details screen.

As an example, let's see the tasks "Andrea Fleet" has done. In your **LifeTime** console (`https://<lifetime_env>/lifetime`), navigate to the **USER MANAGEMENT** tab, choose **USERS**, and select **Andrea Fleet**. There you can find the **View Activity Log** link that displays all tasks made by Andrea.

## Check the Changes Made in the Infrastructure

To help you understand the interactions performed in the infrastructure, you can see the audit logs right where the tasks were made.

As an example, let's see the audit logs related to the "Developer" role. Go to the **USER MANAGEMENT** tab, choose **ROLES**, and then choose the **Developer** role. There you can find the **View Change Log** link that displays all interactions done with this role.

Sometimes it's also useful to see all changes made in the infrastructure, and be able to filter them. For this, go to the **INFRASTRUCTURE** tab, or to the **ENVIRONMENTS** tab in OutSystems Cloud, and click the link **View Audit Logs**.
