# Log data reference

This document lists the fields and descriptions of the database views associated with the platform log records. The views are built on top of the database tables. If you are using the Log streaming service, see [Logged data fields](../log-streaming/detailed-log-map.md)

<div class="info" markdown="1">

Also available: [Log data reference in OutSystems 10](https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/10/Managing_the_Applications_Lifecycle/Monitor_and_Troubleshoot/Logging_database_and_architecture/Log_data_reference).

</div>

## Mapping of the database views and Entities

You can access the log data in Service Studio, by using the PlatformLogs extension. Each entry has the corresponding _Previous entry. For example, for the oslog_General view you have both oslog_General_Previous in the database views and Log_General_Previous in the Entity list.  

Ensure **Add System Dependencies** is in the **Default Role**, as these entities are not inside the system module but considered part of it.

<div class="info" markdown="1">

See [The log tables and views](views-and-tables.md) for more information about the database model.
