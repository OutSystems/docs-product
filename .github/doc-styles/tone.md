# Documentation tone and language rules

Use these rules when writing or reviewing documentation in this repository.

## Tone and voice

Your content must be:

* Friendly and straightforward.
* Clear and concise.
* Inclusive and respectful.
* Free of jargon and sales talk.

## Be brief and confident

* Write short sentences and well-structured paragraphs.
* Do not repeat yourself.
* Prefer statements that describe what the product does. Avoid weak phrasing.

### Be careful with modal verbs

Avoid modal verbs such as can, could, may, might, will, shall, would, should, and must when possible.

* **Yes:** OutSystems lets you create several app types.
* **No:** There are several app types you can create.

## Language and grammar

* Use American English (spelling, word choice, and dates).
* Use the present tense when possible.
* Use contractions (it’s, don’t, there’s) unless the contraction would attach to a product name.
* Use the active voice.
* Use second person ("you") to address the reader. Do not use "we" to refer to OutSystems.
* Be clear and precise. Avoid vague language.

## Capitalization

* Do not capitalize common nouns unless they start a sentence.
* Capitalize proper nouns and brand names (product, company, and technology names).
* For APIs and endpoints, use the exact capitalization as defined in the API documentation.
* For code elements (variables, functions, classes), keep the original capitalization.

## Inclusive, accessible, and global writing

* Use gender-inclusive language.
* Avoid idioms and jokes.
* Do not describe locations using only directional words (left, right, above). Add context for screen readers.
* Do not overuse words like "easy" and "simple".

## Avoid filler politeness

Avoid "sorry" and "please" in technical documentation.

* **Yes:** To view the document, click _View_.
* **No:** To view the document, please click _View_.

## Timeless documentation

* Avoid time-based words and phrases such as new, now, currently, latest, and future.
* Do not pre-announce features or products.
* If you must refer to a new feature, anchor it to a version number or date.

## Clarity rules for pronouns and clauses

* Ensure pronoun references are unambiguous. If there is potential confusion, restate the noun.
* Use `that` for restrictive clauses and `which` for nonrestrictive clauses.
* Use `who` for people.

## Style preferences

* Use a serial comma in lists of three or more items.
* Avoid putting important information in parentheses.
* Use `example.com` for domain examples. Do not use real customer domains.
* Avoid Latin abbreviations:
    * Use "that is" instead of "i.e.".
    * Use "for example" or "such as" instead of "e.g.".
