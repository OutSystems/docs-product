# Map O11 to ODC architecture

<div class="info" markdown="1">

This article only applies to customers with access to the App Conversion Kit.

The mapping step of the [Plan app conversion](plan-intro.md) stage enables you to start assessing the required adjustment needs of your O11 apps. You can focus on small sets of apps based on your different app domains and your teams' development lifecycle.

Before you start, make sure you have an inventory of your O11 apps and modules that you want to convert. OutSystems recommends that you classify your apps with the [Architecture Canvas](https://success.outsystems.com/documentation/best_practices/architecture/designing_the_architecture_of_your_outsystems_applications/the_architecture_canvas/), as this helps with some of the upcoming steps.

As an example, consider the following O11 app and modules inventory.

To map your O11 apps architecture to ODC architecture:

1. Start by [designing your ODC architecture](plan-design-odc-arch.md)
1. Then, do the [O11 to ODC mapping in the Conversion Assessment Tool](plan-map-in-tool.md).
