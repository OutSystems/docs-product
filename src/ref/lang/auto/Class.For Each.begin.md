The For Each Tool repeats the execution of an action path for each entry in a Record List. By default the start index is at the beginning of the list, but you can define it in **Start Index**. **Maximum Iterations** will limit the number of cycles.  The Current variable inside the cycle represents the element of the current iteration. The loop action connector is labeled **Cycle**, while the exit connector has no label. You can swap the connectors by selecting **Swap Connectors** in the menu that shows after right-clicking on the connector.
