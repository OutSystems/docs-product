# Metadata reference

Enter the information about the Screen Template, so the developers who want to create Screens know what's its purpose. Set the preview image to showcase the visual elements.

## Preview image

When developers are browsing the Screen Templates in the **New Screen** window they see the preview images, which help them decide whether to use a Screen Template. Scroll down to the metadata section of the Screen Template and select **Change image** in the **Preview** field.

We recommend you use:

* Format: PNG
* Resolution: 1000 x 625 pixels
* Maximum size: 100 KB

Here are some additional notes:

* You can download [these preview image templates](<https://www.outsystems.com/Downloads/ScreenDetails.aspx?MajorVersion=1&ReleaseId=19347>) for web and mobile to create the previews for your Screen Templates.
* Use a mobile frame in the images for better visibility.
* Capture a representative part of the Screen Template and the main content areas.
* Have important interactions like a sidebar or modal captured in the open state.

## Metadata values

Use the values in the fields to enable the developers to browse and find the templates in the **New Screen** window. Enter the values in the **Metadata** section of the Properties Pane.
