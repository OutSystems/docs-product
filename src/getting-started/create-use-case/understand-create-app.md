# Understanding how to create an app

<div class="info" markdown="1">

Only applies to Windows-only Service Studio.

</div>

## Overview

No prior OutSystems knowledge is needed to get started. But, you must have:

* A personal environment or a free trial. If you don't have either, [sign up for free](https://www.outsystems.com/home/GetStartedForFree.aspx).

* Installed the [latest windows-only version of the Development Environment](https://www.outsystems.com/downloads/).

<div class="info" markdown="1">

For now, use-case specific tutorials and accelerators are available only for the windows version of Service Studio.

This article explains concepts to help you understand the application use case tutorials and how you create your own app.

The tutorials use accelerators, Screen Templates, and UI patterns. Completing a tutorial helps familiarize you with the UI and you learn how different OutSystems features work together to create an app.

OutSystems provides sample data so you can see how your screens look once instantiated. When you publish your app, it's available from your personal environment.

Each application use case has a tutorial. As you progress through this journey you’ll learn how to make changes and add functionality to automate your business solution. At the end of each tutorial, you can open your app in a browser.    

The tutorials use the following common features to speed up the development of your app:

* **Accelerators** - are building blocks that can combine widgets, OutSystems UI patterns, sample data, and logic. Accelerators help you quickly build an app. You can use these accelerators in other apps. Kep in mind that most accelerators are application use case specific.
  
* **Screen Templates** - OutSystems provides built-in Screen Templates and sample data that enables you to view what your users see when using the app. The screens show you one way of solving a business problem using the sample data and logic. As you progress in this journey OutSystems teaches you how to create your own templates. To learn more about Screen Templates, click [here](../../building-apps/ui/screen-templates/intro.md).

* **UI Patterns** - OutSystems has pre-built patterns you can use to implement common UI components. Patterns help you create a consistent look. To preview all the OutSystems UI Patterns, click [here](https://outsystemsui.outsystems.com/OutSystemsUIWebsite/PatternOverview). Widgets are also used in the UI and have a variety of uses such as input fields, radio buttons, and check boxes.

To learn more about screen templates and widgets, watch this [training video](https://www.outsystems.com/training/lesson/1923/ui-development?LearningPathId=18).

To get started open a business use case tutorial from Service Studio. As you progress on this journey, you’ll learn how to make changes to your app. When you publish your app, the system stores a version of your app in your Personal Environment, compiles the code and generates the SQL scripts, updates the database, and deploys the current version of your app. In the second phase, you'll also have a functional app.

Following is a list of application use cases including a short description of the accelerators and the information that displays for users.

## Next step

After creating your app by following the tutorial, make the app your own, by using your own data from an Excel file, an external database, or an external system of record (SoR). Check [this article describes the main external data sources you can use in your app](use-own-data.md).
