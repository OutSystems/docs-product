# Change the look of widgets with Styles Editor

Styles Editor is a panel for editing basic visual properties. Use it to change, for example, font color, margins or border thickness. In the **Interface** tab, open a screen or block, select an element and click the **Styles** tab in the properties pane. Styles Editor panel is also available in **Style Sheet Editor**, where you can use the editor to modify saved styles.

To style a widget use the options in **Font**, **Layout** and **Borders**. Here is an overview of what you can change by using Styles Editor:

Font
:   Style (bold, italic, underline), size and color.

Layout
:     Width, height, alignment (left, center, right) and the background color. Margins and padding. When applicable to the selected element, **Width** and **Margin Left** properties have column count for the grid.

Borders
:   Thickness and color of the borders. Roundness of corners. 

**Margins** and **Borders** have icons to indicate how edits apply to the widget.

| Icon  | Meaning  |
|---|---|
|![Icon in editable properties](images/styles-editor-icon-editable-unlocked.png) | The value applies to all other related properties. |
|![Icon in properties locked for edits](images/styles-editor-icon-editable-locked.png) | The value applies to the current property only. |

All changes apply to the current widget only.

If you want to use the same style on other widgets, save the style as a set of properties (a class). Then, add classes to widgets you want to style in their **Style Classes** section of the Styles Editor. To promote a style to a class, your module needs to have a local theme.

The expandable section **Styles Properties Applied** lists all styles in the widget. Click a style to open Style Sheet Editor at the style definition.

You can edit [CSS](<css.md>) directly in the module [Theme](<themes.md>) for a greater control of the visual elements.

Note that Styles Editor edits can be overridden by the `style` value of the **Extended Properties**, according to the [CSS specificity](<css.md#css-specificity>) rules. Additionally, any class added in `class` extended property isn't visible in the editor.
