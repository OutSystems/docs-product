## Notes

In Internet Explorer 10 and 11, we added some specific behaviors to account for the flicker caused by the slow loading time of polyfill CSS Variables. If there are any JavaScript errors, this will cause the screen to appear white.

You can override the following code to avoid this behavior.

```css
.ie10,
.ie11 {
    display: none;
}

.ie10.ponyfill-ready,
.ie11.ponyfill-ready {
    display: block;
}
```
