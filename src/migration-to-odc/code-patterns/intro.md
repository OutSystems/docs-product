As you plan and prepare your existing O11 app architecture to migrate late to ODC, you must refactor and adjust your O11 implementation for an efficient migration process.

<div class="info" markdown="1">

The OutSystems Migration Toolkit will provide automation in the future to support some of the following patterns. Until then, manually refactor the apps to proceed with the migration.

</div>

Here are some guidelines to refactor your O11 app.

## General

General information about the language elements and architecture in O11 and ODC.

* [Asset consuming O11 system elements](arch-system-element.md)

## Fix in O11

These are the patterns that require modification in the O11 apps.

* [Application consuming a non-read only Entity](arch-non-read-only-entity.md)
* [Asset consuming a Local Storage Entity](arch-local-storage.md)
* [Asset consuming a private Structure](arch-priv-struct.md)
* [Asset consuming a Process](arch-process.md)
* [Asset consuming a reference that is not defined in any mapped ODC asset](arch-not-mapped.md)
* [Asset consuming a reference to a Traditional Web element](convert-trad-web.md)
* [Asset consuming a Resource](arch-resource.md)
* [Asset consuming a Role](arch-role.md)
* [Asset consuming a Screen in mobile app](arch-mobile-screen.md)
* [Asset consuming a Script](arch-script.md)
* [Asset consuming an Application Theme](arch-app-theme.md)
* [Asset consuming an Image from an Application](arch-image.md)
* [Asset consuming an ODC application Block](arch-block.md)
* [Asset consuming an ODC application Client Action](arch-client-action.md)
* [Asset consuming an ODC application Server Action](arch-server-action.md)
* [Asset with outdated or broken dependencies](outdated-or-broken-dependencies.md)
* [Cannot open module](cannot-open-module.md)
* [End users with no email](end-user-no-email.md)
* [Refactor anonymous and registered roles](refactor-anonymous-registered-roles.md)

## Not supported

These are the patterns about elements that are not supported in ODC when compared to O11.

* [The Asset cannot contain BPTs](elem-bpt.md)
* [The Asset cannot contain SOAP](elem-soap.md)

## Fix in ODC

These are the patterns that require modification in the ODC apps.

* [Asset consuming an extension](arch-extension.md)
* [Refactor site properties to be ODC-compatible](refactor-siteproperties.md)
