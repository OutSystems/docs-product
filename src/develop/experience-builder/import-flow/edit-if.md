# Editing Flow Templates

After importing flows into Experience Builder, you can edit them. The way you edit the flows depends on the type of data you want to edit:

* To modify metadata you defined in Experience Builder during the importing process (for example, screens display name, screen preview image) use the [Flow edition process](#edit-the-flow-metadata).

* To apply changes made in Service Studio to the flows template module, use the [Flow reimport process](#reimporting-a-flow).

## Edit the flow metadata

1. Log into Experience Builder and click the **Flows** tab.

## Reimporting a flow

To reimport a flow, you must reimport the entire template module that contains it. Keep in mind that all flows contained in that template module will also be updated by this process.

1. Log into Experience Builder and click the **Flows** tab.

1. Analyze the validation process feedback messages. Your module needs to be re-validated to check if it still complies with Experience Builder guidelines.

    If there are no blocking errors, click the **Next: define flows** button to continue the importing process.
