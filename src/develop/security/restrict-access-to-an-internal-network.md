# Restrict Access to an Internal Network

You can tighten the security of your applications, or part of them, by only allowing the access to end-users who have authenticated themselves in an IP belonging to an internal network.

You can restrict internal network access to the following elements:

* UI Flows of a Web application (restricts the access of the Web Screens within the Flow)
* Exposed SOAP Web Services
* Exposed REST APIs

To restrict these elements to internal network access set its **Internal Access Only** property to `Yes`.
