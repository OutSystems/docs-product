# Touch Events

Applies to Mobile Apps and Reactive Web Apps only

</div>

You can use the Touch Events UI Pattern to enable touch events on a specific widget.

## How to create custom patterns using the Touch Events UI Pattern

You can call the **event.preventDefault()** to prevent the default action associated with each event from occurring. The touchstart and touchend events don't need this action, but touchmove requires it to stop screen scrolling when the user is moving the finger inside the element.

To use the **event.preventDefault()**, use the following string of code:

`$parameters.Evt.preventDefault();`

## How to hide a header during a scroll action

You can use the Touch Events UI pattern to hide a header during a scroll action.

After following these steps and publishing the module, you can test the pattern in your app.

| Element | Code |
|---|---|
|![JavaScript code snippet to hide a header during a scroll action using Touch Events](images/JS_hide.png "JavaScript Code to Hide Header") |  var header = document.querySelector(".header");<br/>header.classList.add("hide");<br/>header.classList.add("header-on-scroll"); |
|![JavaScript code snippet to show a header during a scroll action using Touch Events](images/JS_show.png "JavaScript Code to Show Header") |  var header = document.querySelector(".header");<br/>header.classList.remove("hide");<br/>header.classList.remove("header-on-scroll"); | 
  
**Result**

## Compatibility with other patterns

There might be conflicts with any pattern with touch events (unless the code is altered to expect this behavior).
