# Service Studio Overview

<div class="info" markdown="1">

Before you start using Service Studio, you need to have an OutSystems environment. See the available OutSystems Editions on the [Pricing and Editions](https://www.outsystems.com/pricing-and-editions/) document.

Service Studio is the OutSystems low-code and visual development environment that allows you to:

* Create applications and Modules on the server
* Create the user interfaces for Traditional Web, Reactive Web, and Mobile Applications
* Define the data model
* Define business processes and timers (batch processes)
* Debug your apps

When you open Service Studio to start developing your app, you must connect to an OutSystems environment in the cloud or an on-premise server in your data center. You need to add the server address, your username, and your password.

After you successfully connect, you see the list of applications that are on the server. In the Environment tab where you can:

* Create a new application.
* Install applications and components from the [OutSystems Forge](https://www.outsystems.com/forge/).
* View and access your existing applications.
* Install applications or components from the OutSystems Forge.
