## Getting the settings from bot service { #get-settings }

This section shows you where to locate the Azure settings you need for the OutSystems chat component. You first need to [create a bot service in Azure](#create-bot-service) to get these parameters.

### App id and password { #get-id-pass }

Azure application and password fields are, by default, named **MicrosoftAppId** and **MicrosoftAppPassword**. They are listed under Configuration in the App Service Settings section.

2. In the chatbot configuration page, click **Configuration** in the side menu.

Another way to get the settings is to download the source code. In the bot configuration page, click **Build** in the side menu and then **Download bot source code**. Open the **settings.json** file in the source code folder to get the values.

### Direct line secret { #get-direct-line-key }

You can get the secret after you [create a direct line channel](#add-a-direct-channel-for-a-bot-service) for your bot.

## Troubleshooting

Here are troubleshooting tips that can help you resolve issues in Azure.

### Azure resource provider is not registered

While creating a resource in Azure you get the following error: "Azure (resource name) resource provider is not registered, please click to search (resource handle) and register it first".

Check if the combination of settings in **Subscription** and **Resource group** can be used together. You may be trying to create a resource in a group that doesn't belong to the subscription (or vice versa).
