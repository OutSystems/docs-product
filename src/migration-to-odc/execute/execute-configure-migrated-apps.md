# Configure migrated apps

<div class="info" markdown="1">

This article only applies to customers with access to the Migration Kit.

</div>

After migrating your apps, you may need to configure some settings to ensure the apps work correctly.

You must have [migrated your apps](execute-about-migrate-code.md).

You may need to configure the following:

* If the O11 apps used Site Properties (Settings in ODC) and Timers, configure them in Portal, refer to [Configuration management](https://success.outsystems.com/documentation/outsystems_developer_cloud/managing_outsystems_platform_and_apps/configuration_management/).

* In O11, Site Properties that are set as **secret** are migrated as non-secret values. You must set these values as Settings in ODC and manually set them as Secret. To set app Configurations as secrets, refer to [Set as a secret](https://success.outsystems.com/documentation/outsystems_developer_cloud/security_of_outsystems_developer_cloud/set_as_secret/).

* To configure custom domains, refer to [Configure custom domains](https://success.outsystems.com/documentation/outsystems_developer_cloud/managing_outsystems_platform_and_apps/configure_custom_domains_for_apps/).Â 

* Configure the access to external databases by referring to [Integrate with external data sources](https://success.outsystems.com/documentation/outsystems_developer_cloud/integration_with_external_systems/integrate_with_external_data_sources/).

* In ODC Portal, configure the endpoint of consumed REST services across the stages.

* If your apps need to access resources that aren't publicly accessible, like private REST endpoints or private external databases, [configure the private gateways](https://success.outsystems.com/documentation/outsystems_developer_cloud/managing_outsystems_platform_and_apps/configure_a_private_gateway_to_your_network/).

* If your migrated apps use emails, configure the SMTP server in Portal, refer to [Configure emails](https://success.outsystems.com/documentation/outsystems_developer_cloud/managing_outsystems_platform_and_apps/configure_emails/).

## Next steps

* Test your apps before deploying them to the QA and Production stages.
* Deploy your apps to the stages where you want to migrate data to.
* Delete any testing app data you added to the migrated ODC apps.
* [Migrate data](execute-how-to-migrate-data.md).
