# Extend ODC apps with external logic

<div class="info" markdown="1">

If you are only preparing your code for the migration, at present, OutSystems recommends not making any changes to O11 extensions. Since, we are working to automate the conversion of O11 Custom Code to ODC Custom Code.

</div>

An [extension](../../../integration-with-systems/integration-studio/getting-started/extension.md) is a set of actions, structures, and entities, defined in Integration Studio, that allows integration with external systems. In ODC, you can use external logic to [extend your apps](https://success.outsystems.com/documentation/outsystems_developer_cloud/building_apps/extend_your_apps_with_external_logic_using_custom_code/) with custom C# code.  This code is run in an isolated microservice function.

You must use the external SDK libraries to port your extension code to be compatible with .NET 6.0 libraries. For detailed information on using external logic, best practices, and external logic architecture, refer to [external libraries SDK readme](https://success.outsystems.com/documentation/outsystems_developer_cloud/building_apps/extend_your_apps_with_external_logic_using_custom_code/external_libraries_sdk_reference/).
