# Consuming SOAP Web Services

OutSystems provides support for consuming SOAP Web Services with WSDL 1.1 and SOAP 1.1/1.2.

<div class="info" markdown="1">

**Note:** The SOAP implementation available in previous versions, supporting up to SOAP 1.1, is now **deprecated**. This implementation is only used in modules upgraded to OutSystems 11; any new consumed SOAP web services in OutSystems 11 use the new implementation.

For documentation on this previous SOAP implementation check [Consume a SOAP Web Service](<https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/10/Extensibility_and_Integration/SOAP/Consume_a_SOAP_Web_Service>) topic in OutSystems 10 documentation.
