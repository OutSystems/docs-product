### CarouselGoTo Action

Use this action to go to a specific element in the Carousel. It works on static elements or elements created with a list. When the button that is assigned this action is pressed, the Carousel moves to the specific position of the element. If that position doesn't exist, the Carousel jumps to the last element.

### CarouselNext Action

Use this action to move to the next element in the DOM.

### CarouselPrevious Action

Use this action to move to the previous element in the DOM.

### UpdateCarousel Action

Use this action on the ListRemove action. The action destroys all the dots and recreated them in the DOM based on the number of elements on the Carousel.

### ListRemove

To remove elements from the Carousel, create an action with the ListRemove and UpdateCarousel actions.

## Stacked Cards

You can use the [Stacked Cards](<interaction/stackedcards.md>) actions described below anywhere in OutSystems.
