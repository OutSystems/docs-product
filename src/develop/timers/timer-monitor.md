# Monitor Timers

OutSystems logs Timers information so that you can see their past executions, and when they are scheduled to run. These operations are available at Service Center.

You can only view the logs and information of Timers if you have permissions over the corresponding modules. In LifeTime, you must have at least the **List** security level for the app.

To check the Timer's past activity, for example if there was any error during its execution, proceed as follows:

1. Go to **Service Center**.
1. In the **Monitoring** tab, click **Timers**.
1. Use the filters to find the Timer you want.
