To configure an application to use a given deployment zone do the following:

1. Go to the Service Center management console of your OutSystems environment.

1. Click the name of the application that you are deploying to the new deployment zone.

1. In the **Operation** tab, select the desired deployment zone in the **Deployment Zone** field.

1. Click the **Save** button.
