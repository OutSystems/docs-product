Container "box" where you can drag and drop other widgets, including other containers, to organize the layout of the screen.

Containers allow you to:

* Group content with the same layout (style, position, etc.)
* Group content with the same behavior (for example, content that must be visible or hidden in the screen at the same time)
* Create a nested structure of content
