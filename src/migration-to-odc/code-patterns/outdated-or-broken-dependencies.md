# Asset with outdated or broken dependencies

Outdated or broken dependencies occur when the producer model is updated without refreshing the consumer model. Having an issue with a reference blocks the Migration Assessment Tool to inspect the module.

## How to solve

You must solve this pattern in O11 before proceeding with the code migration to ODC.

### Solve in O11

To refresh the dependencies in your consumer model, refer to [Handle changes in exposed functionality](../../building-apps/reuse-and-refactor/handle-changes.md#refresh-dependencies).
