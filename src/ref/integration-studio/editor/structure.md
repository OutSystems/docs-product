# Structure Editor

The Structure Editor allows you to edit the [properties](<../element-property/structure.md>) of a structure that belongs to your extension.

This editor is displayed when a structure is selected in the [Multi-tree Navigator](<../multi-tree-navigator.md>) or in the [Multi-tab Editor](<../multi-tab-editors.md>).

## Structure Attributes

To manage the structure attributes, see [Attributes Editor](<attributes.md>).

## Change the Structure Properties

You can change the properties of the structure at any time. Simply double-click in the structure in the [Multi-tree navigator](<../workspace.md>) or select the action in the [Multi-tab editor](<../workspace.md>) and change the structure properties.
