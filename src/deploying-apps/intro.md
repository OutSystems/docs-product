# Deploying apps

Once you have completed development, it's time to begin the deployment process. Along with information about version tagging and preparing a deployment plan, this section also covers some special cases, such as refactoring applications, repairing deployed applications, and applying a hotfix.

<div class="info" markdown="1">

For software factories using CI/CD methodology, OutSystems facilitates automatic deployment by integrating leading third-party orchestration platforms to build a continuous delivery pipeline.

See [How to build an OutSystems continuous delivery pipeline](https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/How-to_Guides/DevOps/How_to_build_an_OutSystems_continuous_delivery_pipeline) for information about automating deployment from development to production with a minimum of human intervention.
