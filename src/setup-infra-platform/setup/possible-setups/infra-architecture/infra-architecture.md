# Infrastructure architecture and deployment options

The OutSystems architecture is a layered ecosystem that enables developers to
build applications fast, build them right, and build them for the future.

The top layer of the architecture includes tools, a repository, builders,
processes, and components that simplify challenging aspects of integration.
These architecture components help manage the software development life cycle
(SDLC).

Underpinning this architecture are services for automating complex change
management and architectural review processes, removing repetitive tasks and
guesswork involved in application development, security, code generation, and
logging. The runtime layer offers the option of deployment either in the
OutSystems Cloud or on your systems.


## Standard, reliable technologies

OutSystems runs on standard and scalable technology and doesn't need particular
runtime engines or interpreters. It takes the visual application models you
develop and generates a standard, optimized set of server (.NET) and client
components (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) deployable to standard application servers.

With OutSystems, you deploy standard client-server architectures on the
OutSystems Cloud, your on-premises servers, or public clouds such as AWS or
Azure.

* Application deployment is on IIS application servers running Microsoft Windows
Server.

* Standard relational databases store application data and Platform Server
metadata that your applications use. The currently supported database
management systems are Microsoft SQL Server, Azure SQL Database, and Oracle.
You can also integrate with other databases.

For more information about the supported software versions, check [OutSystems
system
requirements](https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/11/Setting_Up_OutSystems/OutSystems_system_requirements).


## Environment architecture

An OutSystems environment provides all the necessary infrastructure to allow
you to develop and deliver applications. The [available
editions](https://www.outsystems.com/pricing-and-editions) have at least
three environments suited for development, test, and production.

An environment includes a fully functional set of components that allow you to:

* develop visual code and integrations
* compile and deploy the code
* access and use the deployed applications in a browser or mobile device simulator

Environment deployment uses several underlying infrastructure components.

* One or more application servers for the app runtime.
* A database to store metadata and app data.
* An OutSystems Platform Server installation.

![Diagram illustrating the architecture of an OutSystems environment with application servers and databases](images/outsystems-environment-architecture-diag.png "OutSystems Environment Architecture Diagram")


### Application Server

Each environment has dedicated application servers running multiple
applications. App deployment is on Microsoft IIS and Windows Server.

![Diagram showing different infrastructure options for deploying OutSystems applications](images/infra-options-diag.png "Infrastructure Options Diagram")

At runtime, virtual directories map onto application domains. Multiple
application domains run in a worker process.


### Database

You can choose to deploy your environment databases on Microsoft SQL Server,
Azure SQL Database, or Oracle. For SQL and Azure databases, you need to
configure three catalogs, and for Oracle, three schemas:

* Platform database
* Log database
* Session database

The catalogs or schemas can reside in the same database instance or server.
Distinct environments have distinct catalogs or schemas. Non-production
environments often share the same database server, so the different schemas
help maintain separation between them.

![Diagram depicting how distinct environments use separate catalogs or schemas in databases](images/distinct-environments-catalogs-schemas-diag.png "Distinct Environments Catalogs and Schemas Diagram")

You have the flexibility to choose which environments should have dedicated
database servers. As the best practice, you should deploy dedicated database
servers in production environments:

![Diagram highlighting the use of dedicated database servers in production environments](images/environment-dedicated-database-diag.png "Environment Dedicated Database Diagram")


#### Integration with external databases

To build applications using existing data sources, use OutSystems [Integration
Builder](https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/11/Extensibility_and_Integration/Create_connectors_with_Integration_Builder).
Supported databases are:

* SQL Server
* SQL Azure
* Oracle
* MySQL
* PostgreSQL
* DB2 iSeries

Developers can combine local and external data sources without spending
unnecessary time on complex integration projects.


### Platform Server

The Platform Server in each environment orchestrates compilation, deployment,
and management activities for all applications. Platform Server installation is
on all application servers that compose an environment.


#### OutSystems services

The Platform Server installs specific OutSystems services that deliver the
platform’s core functionality. They can either run as a Windows service, a .NET
Core app managed by IIS, or as a library in the applications themselves.

* **Deployment controller service:** Enables the compilation of OutSystems
applications and the automated deployment of the code to multiple servers.

* **Deployment service:** Enables the deployment of OutSystems applications in
the current server.

* **Scheduler service:** is responsible for triggering asynchronous processes
and manages timers, business processes, and emails.

* **Server.API:** responsible for exposing some platform functionality
as services.

* **Server.Identity:** responsible for authenticating users and access control
for the APIs exposed by the Server API.


### Standalone and server farm configurations

As load increases and high availability needs become apparent, it’s possible to
add application servers (also referred to as front ends) to scale
environments horizontally.

A distributed environment architecture allows you to balance costs in
non-production environments with a minimum set of servers while simultaneously
horizontally scaling up highly loaded production environments. On the top access
layer, support for load balancing removes single points of failure.

Two configurations, standalone and server farm, accommodate the differing needs
of each environment.


#### Standalone

The usual architecture for non-production environments is standalone. In this
configuration:

* Deployment of Apps is to a single application server.

* A single queue serves all requests.

* The database installation can reside on the same physical server as the
application server or a dedicated physical server.


#### Server farm

The server farm uses automated resource optimization and management to ensure
an application consumes few resources while freeing unused resources. It's
a typical configuration for production environments and large non-production
environments. In a server farm:

* Provisioning of multiple front-ends deals with increased load and high
availability requirements.

* The OutSystems Deployment Controller service ensures that application
installation is consistent across all front-end servers.

* Multiple queues handle service requests.

* This configuration requires a load balancer.

* High application hosting requirements would typically imply a dedicated
database server.

## Infrastructure architecture

The OutSystems infrastructure is a set for environments that comprise the
lifecycle of a portfolio of applications, managed using the LifeTime
infrastructure management console. An OutSystems infrastructure includes the
following components:

* **Environments** for the product lifecycle management - to deploy your
infrastructure with a separate environment for each phase: development,
functional testing, user acceptance testing (UAT), and production.

* **LifeTime management console** - manages the infrastructure, environments,
applications, IT users, and security. A LifeTime deployment has a dedicated
environment with a dedicated server, database catalogs, and a central console.

* **Pipelines** - to isolate applications based on common characteristics.

* **OutSystems SaaS tools** - that support optional functionality and
accelerate app development.

![Diagram outlining the infrastructure architecture of OutSystems including environments, management console, and pipelines](images/outsystems-infrastructure-architecture-diag.png "OutSystems Infrastructure Architecture Diagram")

### Pipelines

Not all apps have identical requirements; they have different business goals and
non-functional requirements (NFR). With OutSystems, you have the option to
deploy additional pipelines that allow you to isolate a portfolio of
applications that have the same characteristics.

They include a set of environments to enable independent development and
release. Pipelines can help you with governance, compliance, and maintaining
quality standards by allowing you to:

* Isolate lines of **apps with different lifecycle stages** into pipelines.
Each can have a different set of environments where one of the pipelines has an
additional environment for an extra stage, such as mobile device testing.

* Group applications with **similar scalability and high availability needs**.

* **Address compliance** with data segregation policies with separate databases
for more sensitive data.

* **Isolate mission-critical apps**. Pipelines help isolate your
mission-critical applications, catering to data isolation and additional
lifecycle stages (perhaps, extra testing).

All while **maintaining the reusability** of your components across an entire
portfolio.

### OutSystems SaaS tools

Various SaaS tools provided by OutSystems are available. Installation of these
isn't on your servers and requires connectivity to your OutSystems
infrastructure. Connectivity is assured when using OutSystems Cloud, but on
your self-managed infrastructure, you’ll need to be aware of this:

* [Mobile Apps Build Service](https://www.outsystems.com/blog/posts/how-mobile-apps-build-service-works/):
generates mobile packages for installation on mobile devices.

* [AI Mentor Studio](https://www.outsystems.com/platform/architecture-dashboard/):
technical debt monitoring tool that enables you to visualize complex
cross-portfolio architectures, identify problems, and help developers follow
best practices.

* [Workflow Builder](https://www.outsystems.com/blog/posts/workflow-builder-workflow-app-minutes/):
creates workflows to build apps for task management and automation.

* [Experience Builder](https://www.outsystems.com/platform/experience-builder/): prototype
pixel-perfect mobile applications and turn them into production-ready apps.

### Infrastructure architecture examples { #infra-examples }

OutSystems provides the flexibility to start with simple infrastructure.
Edition upgrades and scale-ups are available to accommodate growing needs. The
following examples show different infrastructure architectures compositions,
from simple to complex.

Addons are available in addition to the default configurations. Information on
add-ons is available
[here](https://success.outsystems.com/Support/Enterprise_Customers/OutSystems_Support/Cloud_services_catalog).


#### Basic edition infrastructure

Use OutSystems Cloud's Basic edition to deploy **departmental apps** used only
by your employees, such as an HR onboarding app.

These apps **share a simple life cycle**, so three environments and a single
pipeline suit the needs. They aren’t mission-critical, so a high-availability
setup is unnecessary.

![Diagram showing a simple infrastructure setup for OutSystems Cloud's Basic edition](images/basic-edition-infrastructure-diag.png "Basic Edition Infrastructure Diagram")

For this setup, use these underlying servers:

**Two database servers:**

* A shared database server or instance carries all the catalogs for the
LifeTime, Development, and Test environments.

* A dedicated database server for the Production environment.

**Four front-end servers:**

* 1 for LifeTime
* 1 for Development
* 1 for Test
* 1 for Production


#### Standard edition infrastructure

Let's consider **departmental sales and productivity apps** and a
**mission-critical mobile banking app**.

The lifecycle of this portfolio requires a stage for device testing, so the
**extra UAT environment** supports it.

The mobile banking app requires **extra front ends** to support a B2C
expected usage. A mission-critical application translates to a high
availability infrastructure, so the distribution of front-ends is between two
data centers, and the database has a stand-by replica.

![Diagram of the infrastructure for OutSystems Standard edition with additional environments and servers for high availability](images/standard-edition-infrastructure-diag.png "Standard Edition Infrastructure Diagram")

As a result, this factory required:

**Four database servers:**

* A shared schema or catalog server for LifeTime, Development, and Test.

* One dedicated to UAT.

* One for the Production environment.

* A standby database replica of the Production database

**Eight front-end servers:**

* One for LifeTime
* One for Development
* One for Test
* One for UAT
* Four for Production with a load balancer


#### Enterprise edition infrastructure

This scenario has a portfolio of departmental and external facing applications
with different scaling needs, needing **multiple pipelines**. The external apps
also handle **sensitive data with strict policies** requiring high
availability.

The fundamental differences between the two portfolios require a split into two
pipelines. One of the pipelines needs two front ends in Production, the other
four front ends. The pipelines may require **further scaling** in the future.
Any **specific data access rules** execute in one of the pipelines.

![Diagram representing the complex infrastructure of OutSystems Enterprise edition with multiple pipelines and high availability setups](images/enterprise-edition-infrastructure-diag.png "Enterprise Edition Infrastructure Diagram")

For this infrastructure, two pipelines are necessary:

**Six database servers:**

* One shared database server or instance with all the catalogs of LifeTime and
Development.

* Two databases for the two test environments of both pipelines.

* One database server for the Production environment of the pipeline is on
the left.

* Two database servers (primary and replica) for the Production environment of
the pipeline on the right

**Ten front-end servers:**

* One for LifeTime.

* One in Development.

* Two for Test (one for each pipeline).

* 2 in the Production environment that hosts the departmental applications.

* Four for the Production environment comprising the mission-critical external
facing apps.


## Deployment options

OutSystems builds on reliable technologies, and its scalable architecture allows
adjustments of infrastructure configurations to your needs. OutSystems supports
your infrastructure providers such as AWS and Azure. Application code and data
are always under the customer’s control.

In the OutSystems Cloud, managed infrastructure frees developers to focus on
developing applications on the OutSystems platform.

Deployment can be in a self-managed infrastructure, your data center, or a
public cloud. You manage the runtime application server (IIS), and the operating
system in these scenarios.

![Diagram comparing deployment options in OutSystems Cloud and self-managed infrastructures](images/deployment-options-diag.png "Deployment Options Diagram")

Both OutSystems Cloud and self-managed environments build on the same reliable
technology and components described in this document.
