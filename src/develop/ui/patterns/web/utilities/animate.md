You can use the Animate UI Pattern to create animations within your app. This UI pattern allows you to emphasize elements as they appear on screen which enhances the overall usability of the app.

**How to use the Animate UI Pattern**

1. In Service Studio, in the Toolbox, search for `Animate`.

    The Animate widget is displayed.

    ![](<images/animate-11-ss.png>)

    If the UI widget doesn't display, it's because the dependency isn't added. For example, if you are using a ready-made app, it deletes unused widgets from the module. To make the widget available in your app:

    1. In the Toolbox, click **Search in other modules**.

    1. In **Search in other Modules**, remove any spaces between words in your search text.
    
    1. Select the widget you want to add from the **OutSystemsUIWeb** module, and click **Add Dependency**. 
    
    1. In the Toolbox, search for the widget again.

1. From the Toolbox, drag the Animate widget into the Main Content area of your application's screen.

    ![](<images/animate-1-ss.png>)

1. Add the content you want to animate to Animate widget.

    In this example, we add an image by dragging the Image widget into Animate widget and selecting an image from the sample OutSystems UI images.

1. Select the Animate widget, and on the **Properties** tab, set the relevant properties, for example, where you want the animation to enter and leave the screen and at what speed.

After following these steps and publishing the module, you can test the pattern in your app.
