Table lets you organize the content of the screen in a table. You can also drag other widgets to the cells of the table.

Edit the table layout by these actions from the table toolbox bar: 

* Insert, delete and order rows or columns
* Merge and split table cells

Note that [Row](Class.Row Widget.final.md) and [Cell](Class.Cell Widget.final.md) are part of the Table Widget, but they're different widgets with own properties.
