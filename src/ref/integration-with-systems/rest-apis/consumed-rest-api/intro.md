# Consumed REST API

OutSystems allows you to retrieve or manipulate information from another system by consuming a REST API in your application. This section contains reference information on consumed REST APIs.

To learn more about consuming REST APIs, check the [Consume REST APIs](../../../../integration-with-systems/rest/consume-rest-apis/intro.md) section.
