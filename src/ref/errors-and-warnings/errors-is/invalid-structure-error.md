# Invalid Structure Error

Message
:   `<structure> must have at least one attribute.`

Cause
:   You have a structure with no attributes.

Recommendation
:   Add, at least, one attribute to your structure.

---

Message
:   `<structure>.<attribute> defines a recursive Structure data type definition.`

Cause
:   You have two or more structures with Record attributes that are using a recursive data type definition. For example,you have two structures: `StructureA` and `StructureB`. In `StructureA`, you have a Record attribute whose Record Definition is `StructureB`; and in `StructureB`, you have a Record attribute whose Record Definition is `StructureA`.

Recommendation    
:   [Edit these Record attributes](<../../../integration-with-systems/integration-studio/managing-extensions/entity-attribute.md>) and change their Record Definitions in order to avoid a recursive data type definition.
