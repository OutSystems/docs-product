# Using your data in the UI

<div class="info" markdown="1">

Only applies to Windows-only Service Studio.

</div>

Learn more about how you can customize your app by replacing the sample data in your use-case app with your own data.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started make sure that:

* You have the external data in your app's module by following the [Use external data in your app article](get-external-data.md).

## Replacing data in screens

After completing the tutorial, and depending on your use case, your app includes one or more of the following type of screens:

* A **list screen**, that shows data in a table, a gallery or a list. These screens usually include features like pagination and filters.

* A **detail screen**, that shows details about a single data point. These screens may include a sub-list of data related to the detailed data point.

* A **form screen**, that lets users input data.

Get more info about the specific screens you create for your app use case [here](understand-create-app.md).
