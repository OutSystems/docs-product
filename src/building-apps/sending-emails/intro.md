# Sending emails from apps

<div class="info" markdown="1">

This article is about emails in Reactive and Mobile Apps. For Traditional Web Apps, see [Send an Email From a Traditional Web Application](emails.md).

</div>

Create and send **Emails for Mobile and Reactive** along with **Attachments in Mobile and Reactive emails**.

## Prerequisites

* You're using Service Studio 11.11.12 or later.

* You have configured the SMTP server. See [Configure OutSystems to Send Emails](../../manage-platform-app-lifecycle/configure-send-emails.md) for instructions.

* You're using Platform Server 11.14.0 or later.

**Emails for Mobile and Reactive** along with **Attachments in Mobile and Reactive emails** are generally available in Platform Server 11.14.

## Getting started

The following are the steps to get you started with creating and sending emails:

1. Create an email and add some content to it. See: [Managing emails](managing.md)
2. Create logic that sends emails to users. See: [Sending emails](sending.md)
3. Optionally, add attachments in your emails. See: [Adding email attachments](attachments.md)

## About emails in Reactive Web Apps and Mobile Apps

The following sections cover the more technical details related to the emails in Reactive Web Apps and Mobile Apps.

### How emails work

In Service Studio, you first define the structure of the email and the expressions the platform evaluates to generate the email content. Then, the platform turns the structure into a HTML template, evaluates the expressions, replaces the content, and creates the final HTML. Finally, the platform sends the email message using the configurations you provide in Service Center.

### Data considerations

You can create content for emails by using input parameters, local variables and the scope of the Email widgets expressions. Elements like Aggregates, Data Actions, or Client Variables aren't available in the scope of an Email element.

Emails support compound data types.

### Security consideration

Most modern apps run some logic in the client devices which makes it straightforward to inspect and manipulate the code. When you design emails that require input fields from the client-side of the app, make sure that you [follow security best practices](https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/Best_Practices/Security/Reactive_web_security_best_practices).

### Email clients and CSS

There are many email clients and there's no consistent support for CSS. OutSystems recommends that you test your email content regularly in different clients. To check how different platforms support the CSS you want to use, you can use tools such as, [Can I email](https://www.caniemail.com/).

### CSS from producers

When your Email modules (consumers) use CSS from other modules (producers), the emails show the latest styles that you published in the environment. When you publish the producer, continue using the consumer to get the latest styles from the producer. There's no need to republish the producer.

### Clipped content in Gmail

Google Gmail clips messages if the HTML code is larger than 102 KB. OutSystems recommends you start with Emails that have only basic styles, without the CSS from OutSystems UI.
