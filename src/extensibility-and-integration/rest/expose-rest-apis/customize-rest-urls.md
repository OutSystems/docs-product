OutSystems allows you to customize the URL of your REST API methods according to your needs.  
For example, you could customize this URL:

`GET https://<server>/MyAPI/rest/PhoneBook/GetContact?Id={Id}`  

to the following one:

`GET https://<server>/MyAPI/rest/PhoneBook/Contacts/{Id}`

For that, do the following:

1. In the **Logic** tab, open the **Integrations** folder. 
1. Expand the REST API and select the method you want to change to display its properties. 
1. Set the "URL Path" property of the REST API method to the new custom URL.

    Example: `/Contacts/{Id}`

    Note: Any input parameters included in the URL must be set as mandatory.

The URL property will change accordingly.

The following sections show some examples of how to customize your endpoints.

## Endpoints for Collections Example

Use the same name for methods related to a resource. OutSystems knows which method to execute through the HTTP verb (e.g. `GET`, `POST`):

Default Endpoint | URL Path | Customized Endpoint
---|---|---
`GET https://<server>/MyAPI/rest/PhoneBook/GetContacts` | `/Contacts` | `GET https://<server>/MyAPI/rest/PhoneBook/Contacts`
`POST https://<server>/MyAPI/rest/PhoneBook/CreateContact` | `/Contacts`  | `POST https://<server>/MyAPI/rest/PhoneBook/Contacts`
  
## Endpoints for a Resource Example

When handling a specific resource, start the "URL Path" property value with the collection name and then add one of the following, depending on the HTTP verb:

* For `GET` or `DELETE`: Add the resource identifier (the input parameter of the REST API method) between `{` and `}`.
* For `PUT`: Add nothing, since the resource is already passed in the request Header or Body. 

Default Endpoint | URL Path | Customized Endpoint
---|---|---
`GET https://<server>/MyAPI/rest/PhoneBook/GetContact` | `/Contacts/{Id}`  | `GET https://<server>/MyAPI/rest/PhoneBook/Contacts/{Id}`
`DELETE https://<server>/MyAPI/rest/PhoneBook/DeleteContact` | `/Contacts/{Id}` | `DELETE https://<server>/MyAPI/rest/PhoneBook/Contacts/{Id}`
`PUT https://<server>/MyAPI/rest/PhoneBook/UpdateContact` | `/Contacts` | `PUT https://<server>/MyAPI/rest/PhoneBook/Contacts`

## Endpoints for Sub-Collections Example

With master-detail relationships, handle details as a collection under the master resource:

Default Endpoint  |  URL Path  |  Customized Endpoint  
---|---|---  
`GET https://<server>/MyAPI/rest/PhoneBook/GetContactAddresses` | `/Contacts/{Id}/Addresses` | `GET https://<server>/MyAPI/rest/PhoneBook/Contacts/{Id}/Addresses`
